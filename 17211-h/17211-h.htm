<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>This brief history of the world's greatest war was
prepared upon the suggestion of the National Board
for Historical Service. Its purpose is to expand into
an historical narrative the outline of the study of the
war which the authors prepared for the Board and which
was published by the United States Bureau of Education
as Teachers' Leaflet No. 4, in August, 1918. The arrangement
of chapters and the choice of topics have
been largely determined by the various headings in the
outline for the course in grades seven and eight.</p>

<p>The authors trust that the simple presentation here
given may aid in developing a national comprehension
of the issues involved in the war; and they hope it may
play some part in preparing the American people for
the solution of the great problems which lie immediately
before us.</p>

<h3>EUROPE BEFORE THE GREAT WAR</h3>


<p>To understand the Great War it is not sufficient to
read the daily happenings of military and naval events
as they are told in newspapers and magazines. We
must go back of the facts of to-day and find in national
history and personal ambition the causes of the present
struggle. Years of preparation were necessary
before German military leaders could convert a nation
to their views, or get ready the men, munitions, and
transportation for the war they wanted. Conflicts of
races for hundreds of years have made the southeastern
part of Europe a firebrand in international affairs.
The course of the Russian revolution has been determined
largely by the history of the Russian people and
of the Russian rulers during the past two centuries.
The entrance of England and Italy into the war against
Germany was in each case brought about by causes
which came into existence long before August, 1914.
A person who understands, even in part, the causes of
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 6]<a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a></span>this great struggle, will be in a better position to realize
why America entered the war and what our nation is<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 7]<a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a></span>
fighting for. And better yet, he will be more ready to
take part in settling the many problems of peace which
must come after the war is over. For these reasons,
the first few chapters of this book are devoted to a study
of the important facts of recent European history.</p>

<span class="caption">EUROPE IN 1913</span>
</div>

<p><b>A Hundred Years Ago.</b>&mdash;It is remarkable that almost
exactly a century before the present world war,
Europe was engaged in a somewhat similar struggle
to prevent an ambitious French general, Napoleon
Bonaparte, from becoming the ruler of all that continent,
and of America as well. He had conquered or
intimidated nearly all the states of Europe&mdash;Austria,
Prussia, Russia, Spain, etc.&mdash;except Great Britain.
He once planned a great settlement on the Mississippi
River, and so alarmed President Jefferson that the
latter said the United States might be compelled to
"marry themselves to the British fleet and nation."
But England's navy kept control of the seas; Napoleon's
colony in North America was never founded;
and at last the peoples of Europe rose against their
conqueror, and in the battle of Waterloo, June 18, 1815,
finally overthrew him.</p>

<p><b>Europe Since 1815.</b>&mdash;After the downfall of Napoleon
the rulers of Europe met in conference at Vienna
and sought to restore conditions as they had been before
the war. They were particularly anxious that the
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 8]<a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a></span>great masses of the people in their several nations should
continue to respect what was termed "the divine right
of kings to rule over their subjects." They did not,
except in Great Britain, believe in representative governments.
They feared free speech and independent
newspapers and liberal educational institutions. They
hated all kinds of popular movements by which the
inhabitants of any country might throw off the monarch's
yoke and secure a share in their own government.
For over thirty years the "Holy Allies,"&mdash;the name
applied to the monarchs of Austria, Prussia, and Russia,&mdash;succeeded
tolerably well in keeping the peoples in
subjection. But they had many difficulties to face,
and after 1848 their policy was largely given up.</p>

<p><b>Democratic Movements.</b>&mdash;During the nineteenth
century the people of Europe were restive under the
rule of kings, and gradually governments controlled in
greater or less degree by the people were established.
Almost every decade saw popular uprisings in some of
the European states. About 1820 insurrections occurred
in Greece, in Spain, and in southern Italy; and
the Spanish American colonies revolted from the mother
country. In 1830 popular uprisings took place in
France, Belgium, Germany, Poland, and other places.
In 1848 a far more serious movement occurred, which
overthrew the French monarchy and established a
republic. From France the flame of liberty lighted
fires of insurrection in Germany, Austria, Poland, and
Italy. Similar attempts were made at later times. As
a result of these popular uprisings and of the growing
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 9]<a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a></span>education of all classes of the people, manhood suffrage
and representative institutions were established in most
of the European states.</p>

<p><b>National Aspirations.</b>&mdash;The Holy Allies had refused
to recognize the right of nations to independent existence.
They had bartered peoples and provinces "as
if they were chattels and pawns in a game." But when
the peoples tried to found democratic governments,
they often discovered that the quickest and surest way
was to unite under one government all who belonged to
a given nationality. Thus the last hundred years in
Europe has witnessed the erection of a number of new
national states created by throwing off the yoke of
some foreign ruler. Among the new nations thus
established were (1) Belgium, freed from the kingdom
of Holland; (2) Greece, Serbia, Roumania, Bulgaria,
and Albania, freed from Turkish rule; (3) Italy, united
out of territories controlled by petty sovereigns and
Austrian rulers; (4) Norway, separated from Sweden.
The same period saw also the unification of a number of
German states into the German Empire. But during
this time several races were unsuccessful in obtaining
independence, among which we may note the Poles
(in Russia, Prussia, and Austria), the Czechs (checks),
or Bohemians (in northern Austria), the Finns (in the
northwestern part of the Russian Empire), and the
Slavic people in the southern part of Austria-Hungary.</p>

<p><b>Industrial Development.</b>&mdash;The nineteenth century
was not only a period of political change in Europe. It
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 10]<a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a></span>was also a time of great changes in the general welfare
of the people. It witnessed a remarkable alteration
in everyday employments and habits. In 1800 a great
part of the population was engaged in agriculture.
Manufacturing and commerce were looked upon as of
minor importance. The goods that were produced
were made by hand labor in the workman's own home.
Beginning first in England about 1750 and extending
to the Continent between 1820 and 1860, there came
a great industrial change. The steam engine was applied
to spinning, weaving, and countless other operations
which previously had been performed by hand.
Steam engines could not of course be installed in every
small cottage; hence a number of machines were put
in one factory to be run by one steam engine. The
workers left their small huts and gardens in the country
and came to live in towns and cities. After the steam
engine came steam transportation on land and water.
Then followed an enormous demand for coal, iron, steel,
and other metals. More goods could be produced in
the factories than were needed for the people at home.
Hence arose more extended commerce and the search
for foreign markets.</p>

<p><b>Colonial Expansion.</b>&mdash;In the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, Spain, Portugal, France, and England
settled the American continents and parts of Asia. By
a series of wars in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
the Dutch secured part of the possessions of
Spain and Portugal; and England obtained almost all
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 11]<a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a></span>of the French colonial territories. In the eighteenth
century the thirteen English colonies on the Atlantic
seaboard made good their independence; and in the
nineteenth, Spain lost all of her vast possessions in
America. During the early nineteenth century, Great
Britain, in spite of the loss of the thirteen colonies, was
by far the most successful colonizing country, and her
possessions were to be found in Canada, India, the East
and West Indies, Australia, and Africa.</p>

<p>Leaders of other nations in Europe thought these
colonies of Great Britain were the cause of her wealth
and prosperity. Naturally they too tried to found
colonies in those parts of the world not occupied by
Europeans. They hoped by this means to extend their
power, to find homes for their surplus population, and
to obtain markets for their new manufactured goods.
Thus Africa was parceled out among France, Germany,
Great Britain, Portugal, Belgium, Spain, and Italy.
The islands of the Pacific were seized in the same manner.
Proposals for a partition of China were made by Germany,
Russia, Japan, France, and Great Britain; and
if it had not been for the American demands for the
"open door of trade" and for the "territorial integrity"
of China, that nation probably would have shared the
fate of Africa. The noteworthy fact about this rivalry
for colonies is that almost the entire world, except
China and Japan, came under the domination of Europeans
and their descendants.</p>

<p>Having noted a few general features of European
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 12]<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a></span>history during the nineteenth century, we shall now
take up in turn each of the more important countries.</p>

<p><b>Germany.</b>&mdash;After the overthrow of Napoleon, a
German Confederation was formed. This comprised
thirty-nine states which were bound to each other by
a very weak tie. The union was not so strong even as
that in our own country under the Articles of Confederation.
But there were two states in the German Confederation
which were far stronger than any of the
others; these were Austria and Prussia. Austria had
been a great power in German and European affairs for
centuries; but her rulers were now incompetent and
corrupt. Prussia, on the other hand, was an upstart,
whose strength lay in universal military service. As
the century progressed, the influence of Prussia became
greater; and the jealousy of Austria grew proportionately.
Bismarck, the Prussian prime minister, adopted
a policy of "blood and iron." By this he meant that
Prussia would attain the objects of her ambition by
means of war. Under his guidance she would intimidate
or conquer the other German states and force
them into trade and commercial agreements, or annex
their territory to that of Prussia.</p>

<p>Bismarck looked for success only to the army. With
the king back of him, he defied the people's representatives,
ignored the Prussian constitution, and purposely
picked quarrels with his neighbors. In 1866, in a brief
war of seven weeks, Austria was hopelessly defeated
and forced to retire from the German Confederation.
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 13]<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a></span>In 1870, when he felt sure of his military preparations,
Bismarck altered a telegram and thus brought on a
war with France. The Franco-Prussian War lasted
only a few months; but in that time the French were
thoroughly defeated. Many important results followed
the war: (1) The German states, influenced by
the patriotic excitement of a successful war, founded
the German Empire, with Prussia in the leading position,
and the Prussian king as German emperor or
"Kaiser." (2) A huge indemnity of one billion dollars
was exacted by Prussia from France, and this money,
deposited in the German banks and loaned to individuals,
played a large part in expanding the manufactures
and commerce of Germany. (3) Prussia took away
from France, against the wishes of the inhabitants,
the provinces called Alsace-Lorraine. This "wrong
done to France," as President Wilson has said, "unsettled
the peace of the world for nearly fifty years."
(4) The French people carried through a revolution
and established a republic&mdash;for the third time in
their history&mdash;which has continued down to the
present.</p>

<p>After 1870 Germany made remarkable material progress.
By 1911 her population had grown from 41,000,000
to 65,000,000. Her coal and iron production in 1911
was eight times as much as in 1871. In wealth, commerce,
coal production, and textile industries, among
European countries, Germany was second only to
Great Britain; while in the production of iron and
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 14]<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a></span>steel Germany had passed Great Britain and was
second only to the United States.</p>

<p>But this great industrial and commercial advance
was not accompanied with a corresponding liberality
in government. The constitution of the German
Empire gave very large powers to the emperor, and
very little power to the representatives of the people.
Prussia, the dominant state in the empire, had an antiquated
system of voting which rated men's votes according
to the taxes they paid, and placed political
power in the hands of a small number of capitalists
and wealthy landowners, especially the Junkers
(yoong&acute;kerz), or Prussian nobles. The educational
system, while giving a rudimentary education to all,
was really designed to keep large masses of the people
subject to the military group, the government officials,
and the capitalists. Blind devotion to the emperor
and belief in the necessity of future war in order to
increase German prosperity, were widely taught. The
"mailed fist" was clenched, and "the shining sword"
rattled in the scabbard whenever Germany thought the
other nations of Europe showed her a lack of respect.
Enormous preparations for war were made in order that
Germany might gain from her neighbors the "place
in the sun" which she was determined upon. Other
nations were to be pushed aside or be broken to
pieces in order that the German "super-men" might
enjoy all that they wished of this world's goods and
possessions.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 15]<a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a></span><b>Austria-Hungary.</b>&mdash;The Austro-Hungarian Monarchy
in 1910 had a population of 49,000,000, made up of
peoples and races who spoke different languages and
had different customs, habits, and ideals. These races,
instead of being brought under unifying influences as
foreigners are in the United States, had for centuries
retained their peculiarities. Germans comprised 24 per
cent of the total population; Hungarians, 20 per cent;
Slavic races (including Bohemians, Poles, South Slavs,
and others), 45 per cent; Roumanians, over 6 per
cent; and Italians less than 2 per cent. The Germans
and Hungarians, although only a minority of the total
population, had long exercised political control over
the others and by repressive measures had tried to
stamp out their schools, newspapers, and languages.
Unrest was continuous during the nineteenth century;
and the rise of the independent states of Serbia, Roumania,
and Bulgaria tended to make the Slavic and
Roumanian inhabitants of Austria-Hungary dissatisfied
with their own position.</p>

<p>After 1815 the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy continued
under the rule of the royal family of Hapsburgs,
whose proud history extends back to the fifteenth century.
Austria (but not Hungary) was part of the German
Confederation, and her representative had the
right of presiding at all meetings of the confederation.
Between 1815 and 1848 the Austrian emperor and his
Prime minister were the leaders in opposition to popular
government and national aspirations. But in 1848 a
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 16]<a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a></span>serious uprising took place, and it seemed for a time
that the diverse peoples would fly apart from each other
and establish separate states. The emperor abdicated
and his prime minister fled to England. Francis Joseph,
the young heir to the throne, with the aid of experienced
military leaders succeeded in suppressing the rebellion.
For sixty-eight years (1848-1916) he was personally
popular and held together the composite state.</p>

<p>In 1866 Austria was driven out of the German Confederation
by Prussia. Seven years earlier she had
lost most of her Italian possessions. Thereafter her
interests and ambitions lay to the southeast; and she
bent her energies to extend her territory, influence, and
commerce into the Balkan region. A semblance of
popular government was established in Austria and in
Hungary, which were separated from each other in
ordinary affairs, but continued under the same monarch.
In each country, however, the suffrage and
elections were so juggled that the ruling minority, of
Germans in Austria and of Hungarians in Hungary,
was enabled to keep the majority in subjection.</p>

<p>Austria-Hungary has not progressed as rapidly in
industry and commerce as the countries to the north
and west of her. Her life is still largely agricultural,
and cultivation is often conducted by primitive methods.
Before the war her wealth per person was only $500,
as compared with $1843 in the United States, $1849 in
Great Britain, $1250 in France, and $1230 in Germany.
She possessed only one good seaport, Trieste (tr&#301;-&#277;st&acute;),
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 17]<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a></span>and this partly explained her desire to obtain access to
the Black Sea and the &AElig;gean Sea. About half of her
foreign trade was carried on with Germany. The low
standards of national wealth and production made the
raising of taxes a difficult matter. The government
had a serious struggle to obtain the funds for a large
military and naval program.</p>

<p><b>Italy</b>.&mdash;For a thousand years before 1870 there was
no single government for the entire Italian peninsula.
Although the people were mainly of one race, their
territory was divided into small states ruled by despotic
princes, who were sometimes of Italian families, but
more often were foreigners&mdash;Greeks, Germans, French,
Spanish, and Austrians. The Pope, head of the Roman
Catholic Church, governed nearly one third of the land.
This condition continued after 1815. But during the
nineteenth century the Italians began to realize that
they belonged to one race. They saw that the rule of
foreigners was opposed to the national welfare.</p>

<p>By 1870 the union of all Italy into one kingdom was
completed. In this work three great men participated,
as well as many lesser patriots. The first was Garibal&acute;di,
a man of intense courage and patriotism. He aroused
the young men of Italy to the need of national union
and the expulsion of the foreigners. For over thirty
years he was engaged in various military expeditions
which aided greatly in the establishment of the national
union. The second leader was of an entirely different
character. Count Cavour (ka-voor&acute;) was a statesman,
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 18]<a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a></span>a politician, a deep student of European history, and a
man of great tact. He, too, wished for a united Italy,
but he believed union could not be gained without
foreign assistance. By most skillful means he secured
the support of France and of England, while at the same
time he used Garibaldi and his revolutionists. He had
succeeded, at the time of his death in 1861, in bringing
together all of Italy except Rome and Venice. He won
for the new Italian kingdom a place among the great
nations of Europe.</p>

<p>The third great Italian was Victor Emman&acute;uel, king
of Sardinia. He approved of a limited monarchy, like
that of England, instead of the corrupt despotisms which
existed in most of the Italian peninsula. He knew
how to use men like Cavour and Garibaldi to achieve
the national ambitions. By a popular vote in each
part of Italy Victor Emmanuel was accepted as king of
the united nation. The country was not ready for a
republic; but Victor Emmanuel proved a wise national
leader, willing to reign, according to a written constitution
under which the people's representatives had
the determining voice in the government. In 1870
the king entered Rome and early the next year proclaimed
the city to be the capital of Italy.</p>

<p><b>Belgium.</b>&mdash;The country we now know as Belgium
has had a very checkered history. At one time or
another it has been controlled by German, French,
Spanish, and Austrian rulers. At the opening of the
nineteenth century it was annexed to the kingdom of
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 19]<a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a></span>Holland (1815). But a revolt took place in 1830, and
the Belgians separated from the Dutch and chose a
king for themselves. Their constitution declares that
the government is a "constitutional, representative,
and hereditary monarchy." The government is largely
in the control of the people or their representatives.
There is one voter for every five persons in the population,
nearly the same proportion as in the United
States. In 1839 the principal states of Europe agreed
to recognize Belgium's independence, and in case of
war among themselves to treat her territory as neutral
land, not to be invaded. This treaty was signed by
Prussia as well as by Austria, France, Great Britain,
and Russia. The treaty was again acknowledged by
Prussia in 1870. It was in violation of these treaties,
as we shall see, that Prussian and other German troops
invaded Belgium on August 4, 1914.</p>

<p><b>France.</b>&mdash;In 1789 France entered upon a period of
revolution. The old monarchy was shortly overthrown,
and with it went aristocracy and all the inequalities
of the Middle Ages. A republic, however, did not
long endure; and Napoleon Bonaparte used his position
as a successful general to establish a new monarchy
called the French Empire. After Napoleon's downfall,
the allied monarchs of Europe restored the old line of
kings in France. But the country had outgrown despotism.
A revolution in 1830 deposed one king and
set up another who was ready to rule under the terms
of a constitution. In 1848 this monarchy was displaced
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 20]<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a></span>and the second French republic was established.
But again a Bonaparte, nephew of Napoleon I,
seized the government and established a second empire,
calling himself Napoleon III. He aped the ways
of his great predecessor and tried by foreign conquest
or annexation in Africa, Italy, and Mexico to dazzle
the French people. But he was never popular, and his
reign closed in the defeat and disgrace of the Franco-Prussian
War (1870-71), for which he was partly responsible.</p>

<p>The third French republic was proclaimed in 1870
and is the present government of the country. Under
the constitution there is a senate, the members of which
are elected for nine years, and a lower house, elected
for four years. The president is chosen by these two
houses of the legislature for a term of seven years. No
member of the old royal families may become president
of the republic. The president of France does not
possess nearly so much power as the president of the
United States. Many of the executive duties are performed
by the premier, or prime minister, and other
cabinet ministers.</p>

<p>Republican France has become one of the great
nations of the world, and its democratic institutions are
firmly rooted in the hearts of the people. It has been
compelled to face German militarism by erecting a
system of universal military training. The patriotism
and self-sacrifice of all classes during the Great War
have been beyond praise.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 21]<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a></span><b>Great Britain</b>.&mdash;During the nineteenth century Great
Britain did not experience any of the sudden revolutions
which appeared in nearly every other country of
Europe. For centuries England, Scotland, and Ireland
had possessed representative institutions. When
reforms were needed, they were adopted gradually, by
the natural process of lawmaking, instead of resulting
from rebellion and revolt. In this way Great Britain
had been changed from an aristocratic government to
one founded on democratic principles. By 1884 the
suffrage was nearly as extensive as in the United States.
Parliament became as truly representative of the people's
will as our American Congress. Far-reaching
social reforms were adopted which advanced the general
welfare. Among these reforms were acts for improving
housing conditions, regulating hours of labor and
use of machinery in factories, and establishing a national
insurance system, old-age pensions, and compensation
to injured workmen.</p>

<p>Great Britain was the first nation to experience the
advantages and disadvantages of the new age of coal
and iron, and the new methods of factory production.
Her wealth and commerce grew at a rapid rate, and
she invested her profits in enterprises in many parts of
the world. The factory system drew so many workers
from the farms, that Great Britain no longer raised
sufficient food for her population. She became dependent
upon the United States, Australia, South America,
and other lands for wheat, meat, and other necessaries
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 22]<a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a></span>of life. Her merchant vessels were to be found in all
parts of the world; and her navy was increased from
year to year to protect her commerce and colonies.
From now on it became evident that England's existence
depended upon her ships. If in time of war she lost
control of the seas the enemy could starve her into
submission. Hence during the nineteenth century
Great Britain's policy was to maintain a fleet stronger
than that of any possible combination against her.</p>

<p>England's colonial system had been developed into a
great empire. Principles of English liberty and representative
government were carried by Britishers to
many parts of the world. The American Revolution
showed the mother country that Englishmen would not
brook oppression even by their own king and parliament.
During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries
England adopted the policy of erecting her colonies
into self-governing communities. Thus the separate
colonies in Canada, in Australia, and in South Africa
were grouped in each case into a federal government,
somewhat similar to that of the United States, and
three great British democracies were formed within
the boundaries of the empire. So successful has been
the British system of colonial government that there
has been virtually no question of loyalty during the
Great War. All parts of the dominions have contributed
in men and money to the common cause, and
frequent imperial war conferences have been held in
London. In these conferences representatives from
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 23]<a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a></span>the colonies and the mother country have joined in the
discussion of important imperial questions.</p>

<p><b>Turkey and the Balkans.</b>&mdash;In 1453 the Turks captured
Constantinople. Thereafter their power was
rapidly extended in southeastern Europe and for several
centuries they were the dominant power in the Balkan
peninsula. During this time they overran Hungary
and invaded Austria up to the walls of Vienna. They
subjugated Greece and all the lands now included in
Serbia, Roumania, Bulgaria, Albania, as well as a
number of near-by Austrian, Hungarian, and Russian
provinces.</p>

<p>Many diverse races were included within the Turkish
dominions. They differed among themselves in language,
religion, and culture. The Turks were Mohammedans,
while their subject peoples in Europe were
mainly Christians belonging to the Greek Orthodox
Church.</p>

<p>First driven out of Hungary and Russia during the
eighteenth century, the Turks lost nearly all their
European possessions in the nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries. The subject peoples had kept
their national traditions and customs and from time
to time they aimed at independence. The Turkish
rule was oppressive and at times its methods were
barbarous. If there had been no jealousies among the
great European powers, it is probable that Russia
would have occupied Constantinople long ago. The
other powers, fearing this might make Russia too strong,
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 24]<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a></span>interfered on several occasions to prevent such an
occupation. But the powers could not prevent the
smaller nationalities from attaining their independence
from Turkey. Greece, Serbia, Roumania, Bulgaria,
and Albania were freed from the rule of the "unspeakable
Turk" and erected into independent kingdoms at
various times between 1829 and 1913. Of her great
empire in Europe, Turkey retained, at the outbreak
of the Great War, an area of less than 11,000 square
miles (less than the area of the state of Maryland),
and a population of 1,890,000, which was almost altogether
resident in the two cities of Constantinople and
Adrianople.</p>

<p><b>Russia.</b>&mdash;In 1914 Russia was an empire occupying
one seventh of the land area of the world and inhabited
by about 180,000,000 people. During the nineteenth
century the country was ruled by absolute monarchs
called czars, under whom political and social conditions
were corrupt and oppressive. However, some progress
was made during the century. Serfdom or slavery was
abolished from 1861 to 1866; restraints upon newspapers,
publishers, and schools were partly withdrawn.
Natural resources were developed, factories established,
and railroads built. But these measures only served
to whet the appetite of the people for more liberal
government. The activities of revolutionists and reformers
were met by most severe measures on the
part of the government. Thousands were transported
to Siberia and many were executed. Even as late as
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 25]<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a></span>1903 five thousand persons were imprisoned, exiled,
or executed for political activity against the Czar's
government. An attempt of the people to force a
representative government upon the Czar failed after
a seeming success in 1905-1906; for the Duma, or legislative
assembly, then created was given little power.</p>

<p>Russia has not been fortunate in her relations with
the neighboring states. Her great ambition, the occupation
of Constantinople, was repeatedly balked by
other countries. In an attempt to obtain an ice-free
harbor on the Pacific, Russia brought on the Russo-Japanese
War of 1904-1905, in which she was disastrously
defeated. In another direction Russia was more
successful. She posed as the protector of the Slavic
provinces under Turkish rule and saw the day when
nearly all of them were free.</p>

<p>Russia is a country of vast territory, enormous
population, and unbounded natural resources. But
before the war it had no experience in self-government.
Its land and mineral resources were not used for
national purposes. A small governing class, with the
Czar at the head, controlled its tremendous powers and
wealth. Naturally, when an insurrection is successful
against such a government, the people lose all self-control
and go to great extremes. Liberty and self-government
succeed only when all the people are
willing to abide by the laws made by the majority.
May this time soon come for Russia!</p>

<h3>WHY GERMANY WANTED WAR</h3>


<p>It would be impossible to make a list of all the causes
which led Germany from time to time to take such
action as would tend to force war on one or another
of the nations of Europe. For besides questions of
national honor or of national rights there were the
writings of German philosophers, historians, and scientists,
a great majority of whom maintained that war
was a necessity if men were to continue to live in large
groups or societies. These writers were chiefly Prussian,
but Prussia, including more than half of Germany,
dominated the rest of the empire through the organization
of its government. The following paragraphs
present what seem to be the chief reasons why Germany,
and especially Prussia, wanted war.</p>

<p><b>War as a Profitable Business.</b>&mdash;According to those
German writers there are two results from a successful
war. First, the victors take more or less territory from
the vanquished; second, the victors may demand a
large sum of money, called an indemnity, from the defeated
people, who thus have to pay their conquerors
for having taken the trouble to defeat them.</p>

<p>In both of these instances the result is advantageous
to the winner of the war, and particularly to the governing
class of that nation. Through the taxes from
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 28]<a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a></span>the new territory more money flows into the national
treasury, and a great many new officials must be
appointed. These, of course, for many years are appointed
by the rulers of the victorious nation. Besides
this not only do we find new markets opened up for the
manufacturers and merchants, but the conquered territory
frequently contains great stores of raw materials.
In both cases the goods can now pass to and fro without
the drawbacks of possible embargoes or import taxes
which interfere with the freedom of trade. This is
well illustrated by the results of the seizure of part of
Lorraine by Germany from France in 1870. Lorraine
contains great stores of coal and iron ore. These
Germany wanted. So that part of Lorraine was demanded
which would give to Germany rich mines of
coal and iron. Some other ore deposits, which could
not be easily utilized, she left to France. Not long
afterwards a new process for making iron was discovered
which made the French deposits more valuable
than those Germany had taken. Undoubtedly one of
the reasons for the present war was that Germany
wished to increase her national wealth by seizing the
iron mines that had become so valuable.</p>

<p>Many times before 1870 the Prussians had made
large gains, in the way of increased territory and
prestige, by means of war. It was the boast of many
Prussian kings that each one of them had added to the
lands over which he ruled. In almost every instance
this increase was due to a successful war, enabling the
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 29]<a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a></span>king of Prussia to seize territory which did not belong
to him.</p>

<p>The indemnity which may be collected from a conquered
nation is also a source of profit to the conqueror.
The money is deposited by the government in banks,
which thus have large sums ready to lend to manufacturers
and merchants who wish to increase their business.
The result of this is a great stimulation of
manufactures and commerce. In the case of Germany,
the effect on industry of the $1,000,000,000 of indemnity
which she received from France following the Franco-Prussian
war was so great that Germany was soon manufacturing
more than her people could consume, and
German commercial agents spread all over the globe
seeking to find profitable customers for the surplus.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the German leaders have failed
to realize that the destruction of men and materials in
war is always a great national loss. In the case of a
long war, the losses from these causes may, even for
the victors, overbalance any advantage which may
be secured in the way of territory or money from the
vanquished nation.</p>

<p><b>Germany Wanted Land from her Neighbors.</b>&mdash;The
present war was largely the result of Germany's desire
to secure territory. The territory that was particularly
wanted was in a number of different places.</p>

<p>In the first place, Germany coveted the rest of the
iron mines which she had made the mistake (from her
point of view) of letting France keep in 1870. These
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 30]<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a></span>are located along the northeast frontier of France,
about half a dozen miles from the boundary. Germany
wanted also the greater part of Belgium, because
it has valuable iron ore deposits, and especially because
it has great deposits of coal. It has been said that
without these mines of Belgian coal and of French iron,
which Germany seized at the very beginning of the war,
she would soon have had to give up the fight.</p>

<p>In the second place, Germany's only ports are on
the shallow north coast, and the channels are intricate
and difficult of navigation. These ports are inconveniently
situated for exports from Germany's chief
manufacturing region, the lower Rhine valley. The
best ports for western Germany are Antwerp, in Belgium,
and Rotterdam, in Holland. Germany wanted
a port toward the west through which she could more
conveniently reach her customers in North and South
America and elsewhere. It is interesting to notice
that the river Scheldt (skelt), on which Antwerp is
situated, passes through Holland on its way to the
sea. Even if Germany secured Belgium this would
not give her control of the Antwerp outlet nor would
it give her Rotterdam. It is certain that eventual
domination of Holland was part of Germany's plan.</p>

<p>Germany wanted that part of Russia which was
along the Baltic Sea. The part of Germany adjoining
this, called East Prussia, is the stronghold of the Prussian
Junkers, or landed nobility. These people already
own great estates in the Baltic provinces of Russia.
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 31]<a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a></span>Germany wished to govern this German-owned land
and provide a place to which her surplus population
could emigrate and still be in German territory. The
Junkers were especially anxious for this to come about
as it would greatly increase their power in Germany.</p>

<p>"Pan-Germanists" is the name given to a group of
German leaders who aimed especially to bring all German-speaking
peoples into the German Empire. In
general, however, the same leaders aimed to bring under
German control all the districts that have been mentioned
above, together with the Balkan states and other
lands.</p>

<p><b>Germany Wanted More Colonies.</b>&mdash;Germany's commercial
expansion came after most of the world had been
divided among the other nations. She thought she
must have more colonies to provide her with raw materials
and to give her markets for some of her surplus
manufactures. Other reasons why Germany wanted
colonies were that she might obtain more food, and
that she might establish coaling stations for her navy,
so that it could protect her commerce, especially her
food-carrying ships. As the war has shown, Germany
can hardly produce a full supply of food for her own
people.</p>

<p>The easiest way to get colonies seemed to be by making
war against some nation that already possessed
them, in the hope that a victorious Germany could
seize the colonies she desired. On the other hand,
without war, she had gained some large colonies and
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 32]<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a></span>was assured of others in Africa, and she had secured a
prevailing influence over the immense domains of Turkey
in Asia. By 1914 the Germans had more than half
completed a railroad through Turkey to the Persian
Gulf, and expected soon to dominate the eastern trade
by the Berlin-Bagdad route.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/032.png" width="400" height="517" alt="THE BERLIN-BAGDAD RAILWAY" title="" />
<span class="caption">THE BERLIN-BAGDAD RAILWAY</span>
</div>

<p><b>Germany Wanted "a Place in the Sun."</b>&mdash;Germany
was acknowledged to be the strongest nation in
continental Europe.
Her position as a
world power, however,
was disputed
by Great Britain,
both by reason of
the latter's control
of the sea through
her enormous fleet,
and by reason of
Great Britain's numerous
colonies all
over the world. It
was galling to German
pride to have
to coal her ships at
English coaling stations. She wanted stations of her
own. By bringing on a war that would humble France
to the dust and make Belgium a part of Germany, thus
giving her a chance to seize the colonies of France and
Belgium, Germany would at once attain a position in
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 33]<a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a></span>the world's affairs which would enable her to challenge
the power of any nation on earth.</p>

<p><b>The Survival of the Fittest.</b>&mdash;German thinkers carried
to an extreme the theory of the survival of the
fittest. This doctrine teaches that all living things have
reached their present forms through a gradual development
of those qualities which best fit them to live in
their present surroundings. Those that are best adapted
live on, and produce a new generation that are also well
fitted to survive. Those that are not fitted to their
surroundings soon give up the struggle and die. The
Germans applied this same belief to nations, and claimed
that only those nations survived that could successfully
meet world conditions. They believed that war was
an inevitable world condition, and that that nation
would survive that was best able to fight. They believed
in war, because they believed that just as nature
removes the weak animal or plant by an early death, so
the weak nation should pay the penalty of its weakness
by being defeated in war and absorbed by the stronger
one. War would prove which nation was the most
nearly perfect. The Germans had no doubt that this
nation was Germany. Acceptance of this belief by
the German people had much to do with bringing on
the present war.</p>

<p><b>Germany Wanted to Germanize the World.</b>&mdash;As a
result of the reasoning outlined in the last paragraph,
German writers taught that those things which were
German&mdash;their speech, their literature, their religion,
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 34]<a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a></span>their armies, in short the manners, customs, and
thoughts of the Germans&mdash;were the best possible
manners, and customs, and thoughts. These things all
taken together are what is meant by <i>Kultur</i> (kool-toor&acute;),&mdash;not
merely "culture" as the latter word is generally
used.</p>

<p>Since the Germans believed that their <i>Kultur</i> was
the highest stage of human progress, the next step,
according to the view of their leaders, would be to Germanize
all the rest of the nations of the earth by imposing
German <i>Kultur</i> upon them. If possible, this
was to be brought about with the consent of the other
nations; if not, then it was to be imposed by force.</p>

<h3>GERMAN MILITARISM</h3>


<p><b>What is Militarism?</b>&mdash;Militarism has been defined
as "a policy which maintains huge standing armies for
purposes of aggression." It should be noticed that the
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 35]<a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a></span>mere fact that a nation, through universal conscription,
maintains a large standing army in times of peace does
not convict it of militarism. Every one of the great
European powers except England maintained such an
army, and yet Germany was the only one that we can
say had a militaristic government.</p>

<p>A more narrow definition of militarism is that form of
government in which the military power is in control,
and with the slightest excuse can and does override
the civil authority. This had been the situation in
Germany for many years before the outbreak of the
Great War.</p>

<p>Let us take a glance at the development of this sort
of government. After Napoleon conquered Prussia,
early in the nineteenth century, one of the conditions of
peace was that Prussia should reduce her army to not
more than forty-two thousand men. In order that the
country should not again be so easily conquered, the
king of Prussia enrolled the permitted number of men
for one year, then dismissed that group, and enrolled
another of the same size, and so on. Thus, in the course
of ten years, it would be possible for him to gather an
army of four hundred thousand men who had had at
least one year of military training.</p>

<p>The officers of the army were drawn almost entirely
from among the land-owning nobility. The result was
that there was gradually built up a large class of military
officers on the one hand, and, on the other, a much
larger class, the rank and file of the army. These men
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 36]<a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a></span>had become used, in the army, to obeying implicitly all
the commands of the officers.</p>

<p>This led to several results. Since the officer class
furnished also most of the officials for the civil administration
of the country, the interests of the army came
to be considered the same as the interests of the country
as a whole. A second result was that the governing
class desired to continue a system which gave them so
much power over the common people. We should perhaps
consider as a third result the fact that the possession
of such a splendid and efficient military machine
tended to make its possessors arrogant and unyielding
in their intercourse with other nations.</p>

<p><b>Competition in Armaments.</b>&mdash;After 1870 the German
emperor was the commander of the whole German army,
which was organized and trained on the Prussian
model. The fact that Germany had such an efficient
army caused other nations to be in constant fear of
attack. Therefore her neighbors on the continent of
Europe were led to organize similar armies and make
other preparations for defense.</p>

<p>Moreover, Germany in recent years formed a number
of ambitious projects of expansion and colonization
which would probably bring her into conflict with other
countries. In order to assure herself of success, Germany
proceeded to enlarge and otherwise improve the
organization and equipment of her army. This led
France and Russia to enlarge their armies. So the
competition went on.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 37]<a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a></span><b>Germany's Navy.</b>&mdash;For over a century Great Britain's
control of the seas had been almost undisputed. In
order to carry out her projects of expansion, Germany
required a fleet which, while perhaps not so large as
that of Great Britain, would be large enough to make
the result of a naval battle questionable. Huge money
grants were obtained from the German people, and
for a time more battleships were built by Germany
than by England. England dared not permit the naval
superiority to pass into Germany's hands. The result
was a competition in dreadnaught building quite as
feverish as the competition in armies. The building
and maintenance of these great fleets were a heavy
burden upon the people of both countries. England
made several offers to limit the competition by promising
to build no ships in any year in which Germany
would build none, but Germany in every case refused to
agree to the plan.</p>

<h3>INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE HAGUE CONFERENCES</h3>


<p><b>International Law.</b>&mdash;In the civilized world to-day
each community is made up of citizens who have a right
to the protection of the laws of their community and
who in turn have the duty of obedience to those laws.
During recent centuries improved means of communication
and transportation have brought all parts of the
world closer together, and there has grown up in
the minds of many enlightened thinkers the idea that the
whole civilized world ought to be regarded as a community
of nations. In the past the relations of nations
to one another have been very nearly as bad as that of
persons in savage communities. Quarrels have usually
been settled by contests of strength, called wars. Believers
in the idea of the community of nations argue
that wars would cease or at least become much less
frequent if this idea of a community of nations were
generally accepted.</p>

<p>The body of rules which nations recognize in their
dealings with each other is usually spoken of as <i>international
law</i>. As to certain rules of international
conduct the civilized nations of the world have been in
general agreement for many centuries. Among such rules
are those for the carrying out of treaty obligations, the
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 39]<a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a></span>punishment of piracy, the protection of each other's
ambassadors, the rights of citizens of one country to the
protection of the laws of the country they are visiting,
the protection of women and children in time of war.</p>

<p>As in community law so also in international law
rules have frequently grown up as matters of custom.
In the second place agreements have sometimes been
reached through negotiation and written out in the
form of treaties between the two nations concerned.
In the latter half of the nineteenth century several attempts
were made to strengthen international law by
means of general conferences of the nations. One of
the most famous of these was the Conference of Geneva
in 1864, which reached a number of valuable agreements
on the care of wounded soldiers and gave official international
recognition to the Red Cross. At the very
end of the century occurred the first of the two famous
international conferences at The Hague.</p>

<p>Toward this growing movement in the direction of the
setting up of a community of nations in which each has
equal rights and equally recognizes the force of international
law, the German Empire has taken an attitude
of opposition. She has steadily refused to accept her
place as a member of a family of nations. Her leaders
have taken the ground, as explained in Chapter II,
that strong nations should control weaker nations
whenever it is to their own interest. As a principle this
is just as barbarous as if in a community the man with
the strongest muscles or the biggest club should be permitted
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 40]<a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a></span>to control the actions of his neighbors who
happened to be weaker or less effectively armed. Just
as the strong brutal man must be taught that laws
apply to him as well as to the weaker members of the
community, so must Germany learn to respect the
laws of nations and the rights of weaker peoples.</p>

<p><b>The Call for a World Peace Conference.</b>&mdash;In spite
of the rapid growth of armaments in Europe after 1870
there was growing up among many of the leading thinkers
of the nations a movement looking toward permanent
peace in the world. The movement soon gained
great strength among all classes. Peace societies were
formed, meetings were held, and pamphlets were prepared
and distributed. Toward the close of the century
public opinion in most countries was leaning more
and more toward the idea of universal peace. Governments,
however, were slower to take up the problem.
Strangely enough the first government to take action
in the matter was that of Russia, at the time the most
autocratic of all the nations of Europe.</p>

<p>Two years before the close of the century Czar Nicholas
II sent out an official invitation calling upon the nations
to send representatives to an international conference
to discuss the problem of the prevention of wars. The
Czar pointed out the dangers which must surely result
if the military rivalry of the nations were not checked.
He referred to the fact that European militarism was
using up the strength and the wealth of the nations and
was bringing about a condition of military preparedness
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 41]<a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a></span>which must inevitably lead in the end to a war
more disastrous and terrible than any war in the history
of mankind. The Czar did not go so far as to suggest
complete and immediate disarmament. Every one knew
that Europe was not ready to consider so violent a
change of policy. The Russian invitation merely
proposed that the conference should try to agree upon
some means for putting a limit upon the increase of
armaments. It suggested that the nations should
agree not to increase their military or naval forces for
a certain limited period, not to add to their annual
expenditure of money for military purposes, and to
consider means by which later on there might be an
actual reduction of armaments. It was necessary to
avoid the jealousies which might arise among the great
powers if the capital of one of them were selected for
the conference, so the Czar suggested that the meeting
take place at The Hague, the capital of small, peace-loving
Holland.</p>

<p><b>The First Hague Conference.</b>&mdash;The conference
called by the Czar met on May 18, 1899. All the great
nations of the world sent delegates, as did many of the
smaller nations. In all, twenty-six governments were
represented, twenty of which were European. The
United States and Mexico were the only countries of
the New World which sent representatives. The
queen of Holland showed her appreciation of the honor
conferred upon her country by placing at the disposal
of the conference, as its meeting place, the former
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 42]<a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a></span>summer residence of the royal family, the "House in
the Woods," situated about a mile from the city in the
midst of a beautiful park.</p>

<p><b>Disarmament.</b>&mdash;Although the menace of the tremendous
armaments of Europe had been the chief
reason for the conference, absolutely nothing was accomplished
toward solving that problem. This failure
was largely due to the opposition of Germany, which,
as the strongest military power in Europe, would listen
to no suggestion looking toward the limitation of military
force. At one of the early meetings of the conference
a German delegate brought out clearly and
unmistakably his government's opposition to any consideration
of the subject. In a sarcastic and arrogant
speech he defended the German system of compulsory
military service and her expenditures for military
purposes. While it is extremely doubtful, in view
of the difficulties in the way of any general policy of
disarmament, that much could have been accomplished
by the conference even under the most favorable circumstances,
this stand on the part of the German government
meant the immediate and absolute defeat of
the suggestion. The other nations of Europe had
established their large military systems as a measure
of defense against Germany, so that in the face of that
government's refusal to agree to the policy of limiting
armaments, no neighboring country on the European
continent could adopt it. In the conference, the matter
was dismissed after the adoption of a very general resolution
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 43]<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a></span>expressing the opinion "that the restriction of
military charges ... is extremely desirable for the increase
of the material and moral welfare of mankind."</p>

<p><b>Arbitration.</b>&mdash;The conference met with a somewhat
larger measure of success when it came to discuss the
question of the peaceful settlement of international
disputes, though here also the attitude of the German
government stood in the way of complete success. The
United States from the days of John Jay had taken the
lead among the nations of the world in the policy of
settling international disputes by peaceful means.
Quite different has been the traditional policy of Prussia,
which throughout its history has relied upon force to
accomplish its purposes. All the German wars of the
nineteenth century could easily have been averted if
the Prussian government had honestly desired to settle
its quarrels by peaceful methods. She has taken the
ground, however, that arbitration can only work to
her injury, since she is better prepared for war than
any other nation and can mobilize her army more
rapidly than any of her neighbors. "Arbitration,"
said one of her delegates at The Hague, "would simply
give rival powers time to put themselves in readiness,
and would therefore be a great disadvantage to Germany."
This point of view shows clearly how the
German leaders place the growth of German power far
above such considerations as right and justice.</p>

<p><b>The Hague Peace Tribunal.</b>&mdash;The struggle in the
conference over the question of arbitration centered
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 44]<a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a></span>about the establishment of a permanent tribunal or
international court of arbitration to which nations
might bring their disagreements for settlement. The
United States delegation favored making a definite
list of the kinds of disputes which nations would be
compelled to bring to the tribunal for settlement. On
the other hand, the Kaiser himself sent a dispatch from
Berlin in which he spoke strongly against anything in
the nature of an arbitration tribunal. Largely through
the efforts of Mr. Andrew D. White, head of the American
delegation, the German government was brought
to modify its stand. Germany finally agreed to the
creation of the tribunal, but only on condition that in
no case should the submission of a dispute to it be compulsory.
The tribunal was to be established, but it
would have the right to render a decision only in those
cases which the disagreeing nations might decide to
submit to it.</p>

<p>The Hague Tribunal is not made up of permanent
judges like an ordinary court. It consists of persons
(not more than four from each country) selected by the
various nations from among their citizens of high standing
and broad knowledge of international affairs. From
this long list any powers between whom there is a disagreement
may choose the persons to form a court or
tribunal for their special case.</p>

<p><b>The Second Hague Conference.</b>&mdash;The conference of
1899 had proved an absolute failure so far as disarmament
and compulsory arbitration were concerned. In
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 45]<a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a></span>fact the years immediately following were marked by
two destructive wars: that between Great Britain and
the Boers of South Africa, and the war between Russia
and Japan. These wars made it clear that with the
applications of modern science warfare had become so
terrible that, if the nations could not arrange by agreement
for its abolition, they should at least take steps to
lessen its horrors. This was the chief reason back of
the invitation for a second Hague Conference, which
was issued by the Czar at the suggestion of President
Roosevelt. Forty-seven nations&mdash;nearly all the nations
of the world&mdash;- were represented when the conference
assembled on June 15, 1907.</p>

<p>Attempts were made to reopen the questions of disarmament
and compulsory arbitration, but without
success. Germany again stood firmly against both
suggestions. The conference consequently confined its
efforts almost entirely to drawing up a code of international
laws&mdash;especially those regulating the actual
conduct of war&mdash;known as "the Hague Conventions."
They contain rules about the laying of submarine mines,
the treatment of prisoners, the bombardment of towns,
and the rights of neutrals in time of war; they forbid,
for example, the use of poison or of weapons causing unnecessary
suffering. Even on these questions Germany
stood out against certain changes which would have
made war still more humane. But her delegates took
part in framing the Hague Conventions; and Germany,
like all the other powers later engaged in the Great
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 46]<a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a></span>War, accepted those conventions by formal treaty,
thus binding herself to observe them.</p>

<p><b>Results of the Hague Conferences.</b>&mdash;Leaders of the
movement for universal peace felt that in spite of the
small success of the Hague Conferences a definite beginning
had been made. Many of them were very
hopeful that later conferences would lead to larger results
and that even Germany would swing into line.
There were plans to hold a third conference in 1914 or
1915. As we look back upon the years between 1907
and 1914, it seems hard to understand the general
blindness of the world to the certainty of the coming
struggle. Armaments were piled up at a faster rate
than ever. Naval armaments also entered into the
race. From the point of view of bringing about permanent
peace in the world we must view the conferences
at The Hague as having hopelessly failed.</p>

<p>They did accomplish something, however. Arbitration
was accepted by the nations of the world, in
principle at least. Moreover, the conferences helped
the cause of international law by showing how easily
international agreements could be reached if all the
nations were honestly in favor of peaceful decisions.
Some day when the present war has taught the world
the much needed lessons that the recognition of international
law is necessary to civilization, and that the
nations must join together in its enforcement, the work
begun at The Hague in 1899 and 1907 will be taken up
once more with larger hope of success.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 47]<a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a></span></p>

<h3>INTERNATIONAL JEALOUSIES AND ALLIANCES</h3>


<p>The years between 1870 and 1914 were marked by
growing jealousies among the great powers of Europe.
All were growing in wealth and commerce, and each
looked with envious eyes upon the successes of its neighbors.
In this chapter we are going to consider some
of the special reasons for the growth of international
jealousies during this period, and the grouping of the
great nations into alliances.</p>

<p><b>Alsace-Lorraine.</b>&mdash;At the close of the Franco-Prussian
War in 1871, France was humiliated by being
forced to give up to Germany a large section of her
eastern lands&mdash;Alsace and northeastern Lorraine. It
was true that these provinces had long ago belonged
to Germany. All of this territory, however, had been
French for generations, and much of it for over two
hundred years; and in both provinces the population
was loyal to the French government and violently
opposed to being transferred to the rule of Germany.
But defeated France had no choice in the matter, and
the provinces became part of the German Empire.
France has never forgotten or forgiven this humiliation.
Lloyd George, the British prime minister, in speaking of
the Alsace-Lorraine problem (January, 1918) said, "This
sore has poisoned the peace of Europe for half a century,
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 49]<a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a></span>and until it is cured healthy conditions cannot
be restored."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/049.png" width="300" height="338" alt="ALSACE-LORRAINE" title="" />
<span class="caption">ALSACE-LORRAINE</span>
</div>

<p>German rule in Alsace-Lorraine has been unwise as
well as severe. The teaching of the French language
in the elementary
schools of the provinces
was forbidden.
Military service
in the German
army was made
compulsory despite
the protests of the
inhabitants, who
felt a horror of
some day being
forced to fight
against the French,
whom they regarded
as brothers.
All important offices were filled by Germans from beyond
the Rhine. The police constantly interfered with the
freedom of the people. French newspapers were suppressed
on the slightest excuse. Attempts were made
to prevent Frenchmen from visiting Alsace and Alsatians
from visiting France. German army officers stationed
in the provinces openly ignored the rights of the population
and were upheld in their conduct by the German
government. As time passed the inhabitants grew more
and more dissatisfied with the strict German rule.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 50]<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a></span>In France also hostility to Germany was increased by
the conditions in Alsace-Lorraine. Frenchmen could not
forget that they had been robbed of these provinces. Hope
was kept alive that some day they might be won back. In
the city of Paris, in the Place de la Concorde, there are
eight large marble statues each representing a great city
of France. One of these represents Strassburg, the chief
city of Alsace. Every year, on July 14, the national holiday
of France, the people of Paris have placed a wreath
of mourning on this statue. This custom expresses the
sorrow of France for the loss of her eastern provinces,
as well as her hope that some day they may be restored.</p>

<p><b>Italia Irredenta.</b>&mdash;<i>Italia Irreden&acute;ta</i> in the Italian language means "unredeemed Italy." It refers to the territory adjoining Italy on the north and northeast, occupied
by Italians but not yet redeemed from foreign rule.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/050.png" width="500" height="246" alt="Map of Italia Irredenta" title="" />
<span class="caption">Map of Italia Irredenta</span>
</div>

<p>When in 1871 the kingdom of Italy took its present
form through the union of former Italian states (Chapter
I), Italia Irredenta remained under the rule of Austria.
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 51]<a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a></span>Italians feel, however, that Italian unity is not complete
so long as adjoining lands inhabited by Italian-speaking
people are ruled by foreign governments. So they
regard these lands as "unredeemed."</p>

<p>Italia Irredenta consists chiefly of the Trentino
(tren-tee&acute;no), a triangle of territory dipping down into
the north of Italy, and some land around the northern
end of the Adriatic including the important city of
Trieste. Both of these regions are ruled by Austria.
For many years this situation has led to ill feeling between
the two countries. While it has not had so direct
a bearing on the outbreak of the World War as the question
of Alsace-Lorraine, it nevertheless largely explains the
entrance of Italy into the war on the side of the Allies.</p>

<p><b>Russia and the Bosporus.</b>&mdash;Still another situation
which in the years before the war was the cause of
international jealousies was Russia's long-standing ambition
to control Constantinople on the Bos&acute;porus. As
Constantinople is the capital of the Turkish Empire,
the continued existence of that state, at least on the
continent of Europe, was threatened by Russia's purpose.
Russia has long been in need of an ice-free port as an
outlet for her commerce. Archangel (ark&acute;&#257;n&acute;jel) in the
north is ice-bound most of the year. Vladivostok&acute;,
her port on the Pacific, is ice-bound for three months of
the year. Russian trade by way of the Baltic must pass
through waters controlled by other countries. Naturally
she has turned toward the Bosporus and Dardanelles
(dar-da-nelz&acute;)&mdash;the straits connecting the Black Sea with
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 52]<a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a></span>the Mediterranean&mdash;as the natural outlet for her trade,
and this explains her desire to possess Constantinople.</p>

<p>For centuries Russia has been so much more powerful
than Turkey that she would surely have taken possession
of Constantinople if the other nations of Europe had
not interfered. On two different occasions during the
nineteenth century England came to the assistance of
the Turkish Empire and saved Constantinople from the
Czar. Great Britain was led to take this action through
fear that Russian control of Constantinople might
endanger the safety of her own communications with
India. In the years immediately preceding the outbreak
of the Great War the danger from Germany made
other quarrels of much less importance, and England's
disagreement with Russia over her desire for a trade
outlet was forgotten.</p>

<p><b>European Ambitions in the Balkans.</b>&mdash;Russia has
always felt a strong interest in the small nations of the
Balkan peninsula. Their inhabitants are for the most
part Slavs, of the same race as the Russians themselves,
and they have naturally looked upon the great Slavic
empire of the Czars as their protector. There was, moreover,
a pan-Slavic party in Russia, i.e. a group who
looked forward to a union of all the Slav nations under
the leadership of Russia. The pan-Slavic movement
had its beginning in the help Russia had given these
states in their revolt from Turkey.</p>

<p>Russia's aims and hopes in the Balkans were strongly
opposed by Austria-Hungary. That state has long
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 53]<a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a></span>felt the need of seaports to the southeast and has hoped,
with German support, to secure an outlet on the &AElig;gean
and to control the whole course of the Danube. This
purpose could be accomplished only by annexing a large
part of the Balkan peninsula. The Balkan situation,
therefore, brought Russia and Austria face to face in
opposition to each other. It was one of the most
serious instances of international rivalry in the period
before the war.</p>

<p>Italy also was interested in the Balkan question.
She saw that if the Austrians should annex the Balkan
lands lying to the south they would control the whole
eastern shore of the Adriatic. Italian interests and
ambitions would suffer. This fear, added to the constant
bitterness caused by the problem of Italia Irredenta,
inflamed the hostility of Italy toward Austria.</p>

<p>Finally, Turkey also had an interest in the Balkan
situation. She hoped to benefit by the various jealousies
of the great powers. She believed that fear of a general
war would keep all of them from making any move in
the Balkans and so would prolong her own shaky existence
as a European state.</p>

<p><b>Rival Colonial Empires.</b>&mdash;Some time after the
establishment of the German Empire, her rapidly growing
wealth, population, and trade led her to regret the
opportunities for colonial expansion that she had missed.
She cast jealous eyes upon the vast colonial possessions
of other nations. She also took what was left over,&mdash;several
large regions of Africa, a port in China, a few
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 54]<a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a></span>islands in the Pacific,&mdash;not nearly enough to satisfy
her ambitions. South America was closed to her by
the policy of the United States which is expressed in
the Monroe Doctrine. In Asia, however, she secured
extensive commercial and industrial concessions&mdash;the
forerunners of political control&mdash;in the Turkish Empire.
Germany's desire for colonies was natural enough, but
her jealousy of her more fortunate European neighbors
must be considered as one of the reasons underlying her
military and naval preparedness for war.</p>

<p>Germany's covetous attitude toward the colonial
possessions of other nations led to several serious international disagreements in the years before the Great
War. More than once it almost brought her into
conflict with the government of the United States.
An agreement had been made for the joint control of
the Samoan Islands by Great Britain, Germany, and the
United States. Germany's attempt to enlarge her
interests in the islands led to a quarrel with American
officers. An American flag was seized by armed Germans,
war vessels were sent to Samoa, and a naval
battle seemed about to take place. A hurricane destroyed
the vessels, however, before any fighting had
occurred, and the three countries drew up a treaty which
settled that particular difficulty (1899).</p>

<p>Germany also resented our acquisition of the Philippines
and other Spanish colonies. At the outbreak of
our war with Spain in 1898, when Admiral Dewey
steamed into Manila Bay, he found there a German
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 55]<a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a></span>fleet that was half disposed to interfere with his operations.
But when Dewey showed a willingness to fight,
the Germans withdrew.</p>

<p>Several years later Germany picked a quarrel with
Venezuela and, in defiance of the Monroe Doctrine,
bombarded a fort on her coast. Acting in conjunction
with England and Italy, German warships blockaded
the ports of Venezuela to force the payment of financial
claims. President Roosevelt's insistence that Germany
drop her further plans of aggression, and his promptness
in concentrating the American fleet in the West Indies,
resulted in Germany's accepting a peaceful solution of
the dispute.</p>

<p>In 1911 Germany tried to force France out of Morocco.
Since 1904 France had by common consent taken general
charge of affairs in that country. Later Germany made
objections to this arrangement. Finally, in 1911, when
France was sending troops into the interior to put down
disorders among the natives, Germany sent a gunboat
to Agadir (ah-gah-deer&acute;), on the west coast of Morocco.
It looked as if she intended to take possession of the
port there. France protested and the affair began to
look very warlike. England came to the support of
France, and Germany gave up all claim to Morocco,
taking in exchange about 100,000 square miles in equatorial
Africa. After this humiliation the German
militarists became more determined than ever to force
the war which they thought would make Germany
supreme over her rivals.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 56]<a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a></span><b>The Triple Alliance</b>.&mdash;The various jealousies among
the nations of Europe which we have just considered,
and particularly the general fear of the growing power
of the German Empire, largely explain the strong
international alliances which came into existence between
1870 and 1914.</p>

<p>Germany, after 1870, knew that France would for
many years be too weak to retake Alsace-Lorraine.
All that German leaders had to fear was that France
might succeed in securing powerful friends among the
other nations and that a strong combination of countries
might some day challenge Germany's supremacy on the
Continent. To prevent or at any rate to counterbalance
any such combination, Germany looked about for allies
upon whose help she might rely in case of necessity.
At first she planned a general league of friendship with
the great countries lying to the east and southeast,
Russia and Austria-Hungary. This combination, known
as the League of the Three Emperors, was soon broken
up by the growing jealousies of Russia and Austria in
the Balkans. Germany, having to choose which of
these two nations she would support, decided in favor
of Austria. There followed a growing coldness in the
relations between Germany and Russia.</p>

<p>Germany having allied herself with Austria, looked
about for another nation to give greater strength to the
combination. Her thoughts turned toward Italy, which,
in case of another war against France, could attack the
French southeastern border and so prove a valuable
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 57]<a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a></span>ally. For a number of years there had been ill feeling
between Italy and France, and Germany counted on
this feeling to bring Italy under her influence. The
chief difficulty in the way of Germany's plan was that
Italy would have to abandon her ideas in regard to Italia
Irredenta and enter into friendly relations with Austria,
her old enemy. Italy was finally driven into this
unnatural alliance by the action of France, which in
1881 occupied Tunis, a land which Italy herself had
been planning to annex as a colony. Italy, too weak to
prevent this action of France, entered the alliance with
Germany and Austria into which she had been invited.
So it was that the Triple Alliance was established (1882),
as a league of defense against any nations which should
begin an attack upon any one of the three.</p>

<p><b>The Triple Entente.</b>&mdash;<i>Entente</i> (ahn-tahnt&acute;) is the
French word for understanding or agreement. In the
recent history of Europe it refers to that friendly grouping
of nations which was formed in self-defense against
the Triple Alliance. The war of 1870 had left France
not only humiliated but weakened and isolated. The
formation of the Triple Alliance put out of question
the idea of a successful war against Germany to right
the wrong which France had suffered. In fact it seemed
to make more probable a new attack upon France. Russia
also found herself in a position of isolation. Their
isolation and consequent danger gradually drew these
two nations together, distant as they were from one
another and different as they were in government and
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 58]<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a></span>ideas. So there was established a dual alliance between
the French Republic and the Russian Empire.</p>

<p>Great Britain had for a long time remained outside
the jealousies and combinations of the continental
powers. In fact she had frequently found herself at
odds with France over the rights of the two nations in
Africa, and with Russia over the question of Constantinople
and Russian aggression in Asia. When English
statesmen discovered, however, that the German Empire
was constantly enlarging her navy with a view to
challenging English control of the seas, they felt that it
would be well for Great Britain to seek friendships on
the Continent. Old quarrels with France and Russia
were forgotten. Friendly relations were established,
and Great Britain, France, and Russia entered into a
league of friendship known as the Triple Entente (1907).</p>

<h3>THE BALKAN STATES</h3>

<p><b>The Balkans.</b>&mdash;As we have learned in Chapter I,
the Balkan states are, with the exception of Montenegro,
the result of a series of revolutions which took place
during the last hundred years. These revolutions were
the result of two causes. First there was a growing
restlessness of the different groups of people in the
Balkan peninsula. This was due not only to centuries
of Turkish misrule, but also to the influence of the
republican movement which developed in northern and
western Europe as a result of the French Revolution.
The second cause of the Balkan revolutions was the
gradual growth among the oppressed races of the feeling
that they would better their condition by throwing off
the despotic Turkish rule and by organizing each separate
race into a separate nation. Thus it was that the revolutions
brought into existence a group of small states, each
populated chiefly by one of the races inhabiting the
Balkans.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/060.png"><img src="images/thumb_060.png" width="400" height="632" alt="THE BALKAN STATES 1913" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">THE BALKAN STATES 1913</span>
</div>

<p><b>Races in the Balkans.</b>&mdash;There are more races represented
in the Balkans than in any similar sized territory
in Europe. Most of the Balkan states lie along what
was the northeastern fringe of the Roman Empire.
So we find inhabiting them not only ancient races like
the Greeks and Albanians, but also descendants of
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 60]<a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a></span>Roman colonists like the Roumanians, and other
racial groups like the Serbs and Bulgars, which represent
the survivals of the barbarian invasions of the Middle
Ages. While the larger groups of invaders passed on<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 61]<a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a></span>
to the west, these dropped out and moved southward
into the Balkan peninsula, where their descendants still
remain. We must not think that these are pure races.
There has been much intermixture, and to-day all of the
groups contain a strong Slavic element, although some
are rather unwilling to admit it. There is besides a
Turkish element in the population, as the result of the
long period of Turkish rule, especially in those districts
where many of the original inhabitants accepted Mohammedanism,
as in Albania and Macedonia.</p>

<p><b>The Slavs.</b>&mdash;The Serbs, a Slavic race, form the chief
part of the population in Serbia and Montenegro, as
well as in Bosnia and other parts of southern Austria-Hungary.
Together with the Croats and Slovenes of
southern Austria-Hungary, the Serbs are called the
Jugo-Slavs (yoo&acute;go-slavz) or South-Slavs (<i>jugo</i> means
"south") to distinguish them from the Czechs, Poles,
and Russians of the north. There is, however, a strong
feeling of relationship between these two great Slavic
groups.</p>

<p><b>The Bulgars.</b>&mdash;The Bulgars are descended from a
non-Slavic race allied to the Tatars and Finns. They
came into the Balkan region on the heels of some of the
early migrations and seized the land now called Bulgaria;
there, however, they mingled with the native Slavic
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 62]<a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a></span>people whom they conquered, and whose language they
adopted. There are, besides, many Bulgarians in
the Dobrud&acute;ja&mdash;the district lying between the lower
Danube and the Black Sea. Likewise in the province
of Macedonia, the Bulgarians form the largest element
in the population.</p>

<p><b>The Roumanians.</b>&mdash;Roumania is the old Roman
province of Dacia, and the Roumanians claim to be
descendants of colonists which the Romans sent into
that province as an outpost against invasion. It is
certain that the language spoken by the Roumanians is
much like Latin, but, as a recent writer says, the language
is closer to Latin than the Roumanians are to Romans.</p>

<p><b>The Albanians.</b>&mdash;The Albanian people are descended
from the most ancient of all the races in the Balkan
peninsula; their language is the oldest language spoken
in Europe. For centuries they were nominally subject
to Turkey; but the Turks never really succeeded in
conquering them, though many of the Albanians became
Mohammedans.</p>

<p><b>The Greeks.</b>&mdash;Though the Greeks are descended in
part from the people who inhabited their country in
ancient times, and though they speak a modern form of
the old Greek language, it is certain that the present
inhabitants are a much mixed race. They are largely
Slav, but hold a strong feeling for the great past of their
country. This gives them an unusually strong national
rallying point. In many ways the Greeks are the most
progressive of the Balkan races.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 63]<a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a></span><b>Russia and Austria as Protectors of the Balkan
Countries.</b>&mdash;The struggle between the great powers as
to which of them should become the heirs of "the sick
man of Europe," as the Sultan of Turkey was long ago
called, dates back about a century. Austria on account
of her geographical position and her desire to expand
to the southward, and Russia on account of her desire
for Constantinople and the racial ties connecting her
with the Balkan states, each hoped to be preferred.
Both Austria and Russia, then, for more or less selfish
reasons, were anxious to bring about the break-up of the
Turkish Empire in Europe. Whenever a revolt against
Turkish rule would break out, the revolutionists could
almost always count on the help of one or the other of
these nations.</p>

<p>Since the Slavs and the Greeks hated each other, and
both hated the Bulgarians, there was sometimes a
tendency for the Bulgarians and the Greeks to look
to Austria or Germany for help, as a counterpoise to
Russia's influence on behalf of the Slavic states. At
one time, however, Russia gave great aid to Bulgaria.
In all the twists and turns of Balkan politics we find
Russia or Austria posing as protector of the rights of
one or another of the Balkan states.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when all the Balkan states bordering
Turkey put aside their rivalries and combined for
an attack on Turkey in 1912, Germany and Austria
gave what moral support they could to Turkey. Austria
had no desire to see a strong league of the Balkan states
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 64]<a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a></span>formed to the south of her, a league which would be
largely under the influence of Russia.</p>

<p>German leaders had already formulated their dream
of <i>Mittel-Europa</i> (Mid-Europe), a broad band of
German-controlled
territory extending to Turkey. With Turkey
itself Germany made treaties which practically assured
her control all the way to Bagdad. Germany had no
desire either for a Balkan league, which would block
her way, or for the defeat of Turkey, which might
interfere with the carrying out of the treaties.</p>

<p><b>The Balkan War of 1912.</b>&mdash;Turkish rule in Macedonia
had become increasingly bad. Situated in the
midst of three of the larger Balkan countries, it had
representatives of each among its population. These
countries put aside for the time being their jealousies of
each other. In 1912 Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia, and
Montenegro formed an alliance and presented a demand
to Turkey that Macedonia should be made self-governing.
Most of Europe believed that the German-trained
army of the Turks would annihilate the armies of the
smaller nations. But in a little over a month Turkey
was beaten. Even Constantinople might have been
taken had Bulgaria pursued the advantage gained by
her troops. This time no nation protected Turkey, and
the treaty of peace left her with only a tiny bit of
European territory and the city of Constantinople. Incidentally,
Germany had lost much prestige, for Turkey
had fought the war with the help of German officers
and with German encouragement, and had lost.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 65]<a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a></span><b>The Second Balkan War.</b>&mdash;Unfortunately, the victors
soon quarreled over the spoils. Bulgaria had seized
Thrace and wanted most of Macedonia, including the
city of Saloni&acute;ca, which had been captured by the Greeks.
Austria intervened to prevent Serbia from getting any
increase in territory on the southwest, toward the
Adriatic. Hence Serbia wanted a share of the lands to
the south, claimed by Bulgaria. Bulgaria, backed by
Austria and Germany, refused to make any concessions,
or to leave the dispute to arbitration. She began the
second Balkan war with a night attack on the Serbian
and Greek armies, but was unable to defeat them. On
the contrary Bulgaria was defeated within a month,
partly because Roumania and Turkey also entered the
struggle against her. Bulgaria had to give up much of
her conquests to her former allies. Roumania claimed a
slice off her northeastern corner, and a Turkish army
recaptured Adrianople and neighboring territory from
the hard-pressed Bulgarians.</p>

<p><b>Loss of Prestige by Germany and Austria.</b>&mdash;One of
the important results of these two wars was the loss of
prestige by Germany and Austria. These "Central
Powers," as they were called, had gone out of their way
to encourage first Turkey, and then Bulgaria, and both
these countries had been badly beaten. In any future
diplomacy the opinions and desires of the Central
Powers would have less weight and impressiveness than
formerly. To regain their lost influence it was practically
certain that these nations would, at the earliest
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 66]<a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a></span>opportunity, make an attempt to impose their will
upon the victorious Balkan states.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Suggestions for Study.</b>&mdash;1. Locate Macedonia, the Dobrudja,
Nish, Sofia, Durazzo. 2. Define and explain Mittel-Europa;

prior to its capture by the Turks? 7. Explain the
causes of the second Balkan war. How did the outcome of this
war affect the history of the great European powers?</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>THE BEGINNINGS OF THE GREAT WAR</h3>


<p><b>Germany's Responsibility.</b>&mdash;Germany's tremendous
increase of armaments, her opposition to arbitration,
her hostility to the purpose of the Hague Conferences,
her building up of the Triple Alliance, her challenge to
England's naval supremacy and her refusal to accept
England's suggestion that both nations should limit
their expenditures on naval armaments, the glorification
of war on the part of her teachers and writers,&mdash;all
make it clear that the present Great War was of her
planning. For years she prepared herself to inflict a
crushing blow with all the weight of her powerful army
and navy and establish herself as the mistress of the
world. On this she was willing to stake her very existence.
To use a phrase made famous by one of her leading
military writers, Germany had decided upon "world
power or downfall."</p>

<p>German militarists all looked forward to the day
when her years of preparation would at last reap their
reward through the crushing of Germany's rivals.
England particularly, with her vast trade, her colonial
empire, and her control of the sea, they planned to
lower to a subordinate position in the world. "<i>Der
Tag</i>" (d&#277;r tahkh), "the day" when the long-awaited
war should burst upon the world, was a favorite toast
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 68]<a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a></span>in the German army and navy. As long ago as the end
of the Spanish-American War, a German diplomat said
to an American army officer: "About fifteen years from
now my country will start her great war. She will be
in Paris in about two months after the commencement
of hostilities. Her move on Paris will be but a step to
her real object&mdash;the crushing of England. Everything
will move like clockwork. We will be prepared and
others will not be prepared."</p>

<p><b>Final Preparations.</b>&mdash;In 1913 the German government
decided upon a large increase in her already tremendous
standing army. Immense sums were also appropriated
for aircraft and for huge guns powerful enough to batter
to pieces the strongest fortresses. To pay for this
extra equipment additional heavy taxes were voted.
The new arrangements were all to be completed by the
fall of 1914. Alterations were also hurried on the Kiel
Canal. This waterway, connecting the Baltic with the
North Sea, had been opened in 1895 and was of great
naval importance. The new German battleships, however,
were so large that the canal was not large enough
to admit them. The work of widening and deepening
the passage was undertaken by the government, and
was finally completed on July i, 1914. Preparations
for the Great War were complete at last, both on land
and sea. The gunpowder was ready. All that was
needed was a spark to bring about the explosion.</p>

<p><b>The Austro-Serbian Question.</b>&mdash;For years before the
war the Serbs and other Jugo-Slavs in the southern
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 69]<a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a></span>provinces of Austria-Hungary had been dissatisfied
with Austrian rule. The Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina
(h&#277;r-ts&#277;-go-vee&acute;nah) were especially aroused when
those provinces, after a long temporary government by
Austria-Hungary, were formally annexed by that power
in 1908. Their wish was for union with the adjoining
Serbian kingdom. Their aspirations did not cause
very much trouble while Serbia was small and weak;
but when, as a result of the Balkan wars, Serbia was
revealed to the world as a warlike nation with extended
boundaries and growing national ambitions, the Austrian
Serbs grew restless. There is little doubt that Serbs of
Serbia had much to do with the anti-Austrian activities
that rapidly spread among their brothers within the
Austrian Empire. The Austrian government, much
disturbed by a movement that threatened to spread
among her other subject populations, began to seek a
pretext for crushing her southern neighbor and so
settling the troublesome Serbian question once for all.</p>

<p>In 1913, at the close of the second Balkan war,
Austria-Hungary informed her allies, Italy and Germany,
of her intention to make war upon Serbia, and
asked for the support of those countries. Italy refused
to have any part in the matter. Germany, realizing
that Russia would probably come to the assistance of
Serbia and that a general European war might follow,
no doubt prevailed upon Austria to stay her hand.
Germany's preparations at that time were not quite
complete.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 70]<a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a></span><b>The Assassination of Francis Ferdinand.</b>&mdash;In the
early summer of 1914 occurred the event that was
destined to plunge the world into war. Archduke
Francis Ferdinand, heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary,
made a visit to the southern provinces of the monarchy.
On June 28, while he and his wife were driving
through the streets of Serajevo (s&#277;r&acute;a-y&#257;-vo), in Bosnia,
three pistol shots were fired into the carriage, mortally
wounding the archduke and his wife. The assassin was
an Austrian Serb, a member of a Serbian secret society
which had for its aim the separation of the Serb provinces
from Austria-Hungary and their annexation to the
kingdom of Serbia. The crime caused great excitement
and horror throughout Europe. But the deed had
given Austria the opportunity to settle its account with
Serbia and thus put an end to the Serb plottings within
the Austrian borders.</p>

<p><b>The Decision for War.</b>&mdash;There is evidence that on
July 5, one week after the murder at Serajevo, a secret
meeting of German and Austrian statesmen and generals
took place in the German emperor's palace at Potsdam,
a suburb of Berlin. Probably at this conference it was
definitely decided that the assassination of the Austrian
crown prince should be used as a pretext for crushing
Serbia. Austria, it was expected, would thus permanently
settle her Serbian problem. Germany must have
known that this action would probably lead to a general
European war, since Russia would come to the
rescue of Serbia and France would stand by Russia.
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 71]<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a></span>But Germany was ready at last, and so the terrible
decision was made.</p>

<p><b>The Austrian Ultimatum.</b>&mdash;On July 23, the Austro-Hungarian
government sent a note to the government of
Serbia holding her accountable for the Serajevo murder
and making a number of humiliating demands. Serbia
was told she must suppress all newspapers inciting enmity
to Austria, that she must dissolve all societies that were
working toward "Pan-Serbism," that she must dismiss
from the Serbian public service all officials whom the
Austrian government should officially accuse of plotting
against Austria, that she must accept the help of Austrian
officials in Serbia in the putting down of anti-Austrian
activities and in searching out accessories to the plot of
June 28, that she must arrest two Serbian officials who
had been implicated by the trial in Serajevo, and that
she must put a stop to the smuggling of arms from
Serbia into Austria.</p>

<p>The demand that Serbia admit Austrian officials into
Serbia to take part in the work of investigation and
suppression was an intolerable invasion of Serbia's
sovereignty within her own borders. But the most
threatening part of the note was its conclusion: "The
Austro-Hungarian government expects the reply of the
royal [Serbian] government at the latest by 6 o'clock
on Saturday evening, the 25th of July." In other
words, the note was an ultimatum giving Serbia a
period of only forty-eight hours in which to agree to the
Austrian demands.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 72]<a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a></span><b>Serbia's Reply.</b>&mdash;Serbia's answer to the Austrian
ultimatum was delivered within a few minutes of the
time set. She agreed, practically, to all the Austrian
demands except those which required that Austrian
officials should conduct investigations and suppress conspiracies
in Serbia, and she even went part way toward
accepting those. Serbia went on to suggest that if
Austria was not entirely satisfied with the reply, the
points still in dispute should be referred to the international
tribunal at The Hague. This reply the
Austrian government considered unsatisfactory. Forty-five
minutes after the Serbian note had been placed in
the hands of the Austrian minister to Serbia that official
handed a notice to the Serbian government stating "that
not having received a satisfactory answer within the
time limit set, he was leaving Belgrade" (the Serbian
capital). Austria-Hungary made immediate preparations
for the invasion of Serbia and on July 28 declared war.</p>

<p><b>Efforts for Peace.</b>&mdash;Meanwhile Great Britain,
France, and Italy were putting forth every effort to
preserve the peace of Europe. In these efforts the lead
was taken by Sir Edward Grey, the British foreign
minister. As early as July 26 he urged a conference at
London of the representatives of France, Germany,
Italy, and Great Britain to find some solution of the
problem which might be satisfactory to both Austria
and Russia. Italy and France agreed at once, but
Germany raised objections. Germany's only suggestion
for preserving the general peace of Europe was that
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 73]<a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a></span>Austria should be permitted to deal with Serbia as she
pleased, without interference from any other power.
And so it continued through those critical days. Every
effort made by England looking toward a peaceful
settlement of the quarrel was baffled by Germany's
refusal to co&ouml;perate. This is not difficult to understand
in the light of our later knowledge of the plans and
aims of the German government.</p>

<p><b>The Declarations of War.</b>&mdash;Austria's declaration
of war on Serbia (July 28) was followed by the general
mobilization of Austria's troops. Austria maintained
that all her armies were for the war on Serbia, but her
preparations were so extensive that it was clear she
was getting ready to fight Russia also. In reply Russia
began to mobilize her troops, partly to prevent the
destruction of Serbia, but also to defend herself from
possible Austrian attacks. Russia definitely notified
Germany that her mobilization was directed against
Austria only. Meanwhile England continued her efforts
to bring about a conference of the powers, a plan which
Germany continued to foil. The Czar in a formal
telegram to the Kaiser on July 29 suggested that the
Austro-Serbian problem be given over to the Hague
Tribunal, a suggestion which would have led to peace.
Nothing came of this proposal.</p>

<p>On July 31 the German government, on the ground
that Russia's mobilization was a threat of war, sent
ultimatums to both Russia and France. The ultimatum
to Russia gave that government twelve hours
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 74]<a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a></span>in which to stop all war preparations against both
Germany and Austria. The ultimatum to France
informed that government of the message just sent to
Russia, and demanded a reply within eighteen hours as
to whether France would remain neutral in case of war
between Germany and Russia. The crowds in the
streets of Berlin went wild with joy over the news of
the two ultimatums. There were cries of "On to Paris"
and "On to St. Petersburg." The Kaiser addressed his
people from the balcony of his palace. In the course
of his speech, he said, "The sword is being forced into
our hand." The government of Germany had decided
to make its people believe that they were about to fight
in self-defense.</p>

<p>Russia would not demobilize her armies under a German
threat. Consequently the next day, August 1,
Germany declared war upon Russia. Two days later,
August 3, Germany declared war on France because that
country had refused to desert her ally in this time of
danger. The greatest war of all history had begun.</p>

<p><b>Great Britain Enters the War.</b>&mdash;The German military
leaders felt sure that Great Britain would remain
neutral in case of a general European war. They
based this belief on the peaceful temper of the English
people, upon the serious domestic problems she was
facing, such as the question of woman suffrage, Irish
Home Rule, and the threatening labor situation. Germany
regarded England as a nation of shopkeepers who
would not fight unless they were attacked. After Germany
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 75]<a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a></span>had made herself supreme on the Continent
England's turn would come.</p>

<p>Great Britain's agreement with France and Russia,
the other members of the Triple Entente, did not go
so far as to require her to join them in case they should
be involved in war. It is difficult to say whether or
not Great Britain would have decided to enter the
conflict at this time if a new element had not been
introduced into the question by Germany's invasion of
Belgium. Of this invasion more will be said in the
following chapter. All that need be mentioned here is
that Germany, in spite of a long-standing treaty to
observe Belgium's neutrality, had decided on marching
through that country as the best route to Paris. Great
Britain, as one of the nations which had promised to
protect the neutrality of Belgium, immediately demanded
of the German government that it withdraw
its plan of invasion. Germany refused, and on August
4 Great Britain declared war. So one week after
Austria's declaration of war against Serbia all the
powers of the Triple Entente&mdash;commonly called the
Allies&mdash;were in arms against Germany and Austria.
Italy, the third member of the Triple Alliance, on
August 1 declared herself neutral, much to the disappointment
and anger of the Central Powers, her former
allies. Her treaty with them provided that she should
come to their aid only in case they were attacked, and
so did not apply to the present war, in which Germany
and Austria were the aggressors.</p>

<h3>THE WAR IN 1914</h3>


<p><b>German Plan of Attack.</b>&mdash;As soon as the German
leaders had determined upon war, their military machine
was set in motion. The plan was first to attack
France and crush her armies before the slow-moving
Russians could get a force together; and then, after
the defeat of France, to turn to the east and subdue
Russia. The success of the plan was dependent upon
the swift overthrow of France; and this in turn hinged
upon the question as to whether German armies could
invade France before the French were ready. Speed
was the essential thing, and in order to gain speed
Germany committed one of the greatest crimes in
modern history.</p>

<p>From the nearest point on the German boundary to
Paris is only one hundred and seventy miles. But no
rapid invasion of France could be made in this direction
for two reasons: first, because of the very strong
forts which protected the French frontier; and second,
on account of the nature of the land, which presents
to the east a series of five easily defended ridges, each
of which would have to be stormed by an invader. A
German attack directly across the French frontier
could move but slowly past these natural and military
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 78]<a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a></span>obstacles; and the French nation would have ample
time to mobilize its forces.</p>

<p>Consequently the German military leaders determined
to attack France from the northeast. Here a
comparatively level plain stretched from Germany
through Belgium and France up to Paris itself. Many
good roads and railways traversed the land. Few
natural barriers existed to aid the defenders, and France,
trusting to the neutrality of Belgium, had no strong
fortifications on her northeastern frontier. One obstacle
to German invasion existed; it was what the
German Chancellor once<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> called "a scrap of paper"&mdash;a
promise to respect the neutrality of Belgium, which
Prussia, France, and England had agreed to by formal
treaties. Similar treaties guaranteed the neutrality
of Luxemburg, a small country east of Belgium. Upon
these promises France had depended for the protection
of her northeastern border; for the German Empire
had accepted all the rights and all the duties of the
treaties made by Prussia. But now, under the plea
of necessity which "knows no law," the German rulers
determined to break their promises, violate the neutrality
of Belgium and Luxemburg, and crush France
before an aroused and alarmed world could interfere.</p>

<p><b>Belgium Blocks the German Plan.</b>&mdash;The invasion
of Belgium had two results which the Germans had
not foreseen. In the first place, it brought Great
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 79]<a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a></span>Britain immediately into the war to the aid of Belgium
and France. In the second place, the Belgian king and
people refused to be bought off with a promise of compensation;
they made the high decision to defend their
country as long as possible against the terrible German
army-machine. Said the Belgian king: "A country
which defends itself commands the respect of all; that
country cannot perish." This action of Belgium disarranged
the German army plans; instead of reaching
Paris according to schedule, the Germans were delayed
in Belgium for ten days. These ten days were full of
horror and suffering and defeat for the brave Belgians;
but they are precious days in the light of history. They
gave time for the French to mobilize their armies and
bring them up to the northeast; and they enabled
Great Britain to send across the English Channel her
first hundred thousand troops. In this way Paris was
saved from capture, and France from conquest; and
probably the whole world from German domination.
The German plans for world conquest met their first
defeat at the hands of brave little Belgium. The
would-be conquerors had forgotten to include in their
time-table the elements of honor, patriotism, and self-sacrifice.</p>

<span class="caption">THE WESTERN FRONT 1914</span>
</div>

<p><b>The German Advance.</b>&mdash;Luxemburg was occupied
without resistance, for that little country had no army.
On August 4, 1914, the German armies attacked the
Belgian fortress of Liege (lee-&#277;zh&acute;), and within twenty-three
days Belgium was overrun, its capital taken, and all
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 80]<a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a></span>the important places except Antwerp captured. After
the delay in Belgium, the main German armies advanced
into France. Here they were met (August 21-23) by
French and British troops; but the defenders were not
yet strong enough to stop the German advance. For
twelve days they fell back toward Paris, fighting continually,
until the invaders were within twenty miles
of the city. The French government and archives
were withdrawn from Paris to Bordeaux in the southwest,
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 81]<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a></span>so imminent seemed the capture of the capital.
The battle line now extended for one hundred and
seventy-five miles eastward from near Paris to the fortress
of Verdun.</p>

<p><b>The First Battle of the Marne.</b>&mdash;In the meantime
the French commander, General Joffre (zhofr), had
secretly been collecting another army with which to
attack the invaders on the flank from the west. At
the right moment he hurled this army upon the German
flank, while the men on the main battle line were commanded
to "face about and accept death rather than
surrender." On September 6-10 took place the first
great battle of the Marne, during which the Germans,
under these new attacks, were compelled to retreat
fifty miles from their most advanced position. The
French armies had rescued Paris in the nick of time.
The French government once more returned to its
capital. "France had saved herself and Europe."</p>

<p><b>The Race to the Coast.</b>&mdash;On reaching the river
Aisne (&acirc;n) the German armies had time to entrench
themselves and thus beat off the heavy attacks of the
French and British (September 12-17). The Allied
armies in turn began to entrench opposite the German
positions. But both armies turned toward the north
in a race to reach the North Sea and outflank the enemy.
The Germans were particularly anxious to reach Calais
(ca-l&#277;&acute;) and cut the direct line of communication between
England and France. Antwerp surrendered to
the Germans on October 9; Lille (leel) on the 13th.
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 82]<a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a></span>In tremendous massed attacks the Germans sought in
vain to break through the British lines (Battle of Flanders,
October 17 to November 15). The German losses
were upwards of 150,000 men. On the coast the Belgians
cut the dikes of the river Yser (&#299;&acute;ser) and flooded
the neighboring lowlands, thus putting a stop to any
further advance of the enemy.</p>

<p><b>Trench Warfare.</b>&mdash;By this time the combatants
had reached a temporary deadlock. Both had adopted
trench tactics, and for over three hundred miles, from
the sea to the Swiss border, two systems of entrenchments
paralleled one another. The trenches were
protected in front by intricate networks of barbed
wire. Looked at from above, the trenches seemed
to be dug with little system. But they rigidly adhered
to one military maxim,&mdash;that fortifications must not
continue in a straight line, because such straight trenches
are liable to be enfiladed from either end. Hence the
trenches curve and twist, with here and there supporting
trenches and supply trenches. Sometimes the
trenches are covered; sometimes dugouts and caves
are constructed. Every turn or corner is protected
with machine-guns. In some portions of the line these
trenches faced one another for over four years with
scarcely any change in their relative locations.</p>

<p><b>German Treatment of Occupied Territory.</b>&mdash;Eastward
of the German trenches lay all of Belgium except
a very small corner, and the richest manufacturing
districts of France, including eighty per cent of the
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 83]<a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a></span>iron and steel industries, and fifty per cent of the coal.
On the other hand the Allies had occupied only a small
section of German territory at the southern end of the
line, in Alsace.</p>

<p>German occupation of Belgium and northeastern
France was accompanied by horrible barbarities and
systematic frightfulness, which were in violation of
the Hague Conventions as well as of other laws and
usages of civilized warfare. The aim at first was to
terrorize the people and reduce them to a condition of
fear and of servility to the conquerors. Men and
women were executed without adequate evidence or
trial; many German soldiers were quartered in the
homes; at the slightest sign of resistance innocent
persons were punished for the guilty; immense fines
and forced contributions were imposed upon the communities;
furniture, works of art, beautiful buildings,
and historic structures were ruthlessly pillaged and
destroyed. In the second place, the Germans began
a systematic plundering of the occupied country, taking
for transportation to Germany anything they deemed
useful or valuable. Nearly every article made of
metal, wool, rubber, or leather was seized. Machinery
from Belgian and French factories was taken to German
establishments. Households were compelled to surrender
bathtubs, door knobs and knockers, kitchen
utensils, gas fixtures, bedclothes, etc. Food, farm
animals, and farm products were confiscated; and the
population was saved from actual starvation only by
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 84]<a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a></span>the energies of Belgium's friends in France, England,
and America. At a later time, a third policy of the
Germans was to drag Belgian and French young men
and women away from their families and relatives
and compel them to work far from their homes in
factories, fields, and mines. Probably more than two
hundred thousand persons were forced into this industrial
slavery. Finally, where the Germans were forced
to retire from the lands they had occupied in northern
France and in Belgium, they sought to reduce much of
the evacuated territory to a desert condition. Not
only were bridges and roads destroyed, but houses,
factories, and churches were leveled to the ground,
and the foundation walls and cellars were obliterated.
In some parts of France even the fruit trees and
grapevines, the product of many years' growth and
care, were systematically destroyed, and everything
which might make the land habitable disappeared.</p>

<p><b>The War in the East.</b>&mdash;As has already been explained,
the German military leaders had counted upon
a rapid crushing of France by way of Belgium before
Russia should have time to complete her military preparations
for attacking eastern Germany. But during
the time lost through the unexpected resistance of
Belgium huge Russian armies were gathered together
in Russian Poland for an invasion of Germany and
Austria-Hungary.</p>

<p>The western border of Russian Poland is less
than two hundred miles from Berlin. But Russia
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 85]<a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a></span>could not advance along this road without running
the risk of having the Germans from the north
and the Austrians
from the south cut
off her armies from
their sources of
supply in Russia.
In other words,
Russia dared not
advance on Berlin
without first driving
the Germans out
of East Prussia and
the Austrians from
Galicia. Hence the
plan of her campaign
in 1914 was
to invade these two
provinces.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/085.png" width="400" height="535" alt="EASTERN FRONT
Dec. 31, 1914" title="" />
<span class="caption">EASTERN FRONT
Dec. 31, 1914</span>
</div>

<p><b>Battle of Tannenberg.</b>&mdash;Two Russian armies entered
East Prussia in the middle of August. At first they
met with success. The nature of the country, however,
was against them, as there was a chain of almost impassable
lakes, marshes, and rivers stretching across their
route. In this difficult territory they were surprised by
German reinforcements which had been rushed to the
east. In the battle of Tan&acute;nenberg (August 26-31),
the German troops under the command of General
von Hindenburg inflicted a crushing defeat upon the
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 86]<a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a></span>Russians, capturing 70,000 men and large quantities
of supplies. Hindenburg followed up his success,
and the Russians were completely expelled from East
Prussia.</p>

<p><b>The Russians Overrun Galicia.</b>&mdash;The second part
of the Russian plan, the invasion of Galicia, was more
successful. In September the important city of Lemberg
was taken, and the fortress of Przemysl (pshem&acute;ishl)
was besieged. By December almost the whole province
was in Russian hands. South of Galicia, separating
it from Hungary, are the Carpathian Mountains.
Russian troops penetrated the passes of this mountain
wall and conducted a series of successful raids upon
the plains of northern Hungary.</p>

<p><b>The Russian Situation at the Close of 1914.</b>&mdash;At the
end of the year Russia, while she had achieved success
in Galicia, had failed in East Prussia. An advance
toward Berlin was for the time out of the question.
Indeed the Germans had themselves taken the offensive
and had entered Russian Poland. In October
an advance of German and Austrian troops threatened
Warsaw, the most important city in Poland. The
Russians in spite of strong efforts were unable to drive
their enemies entirely out of this region. On the whole,
therefore, the Russian situation at the end of 1914 was
disappointing. Russia's accomplishment consisted of
her victories in Galicia, and, probably more important,
the drawing of German troops from the western front
and the consequent weakening of Germany's offensive
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 87]<a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a></span>in France and Belgium. Russia was no farther on the
road to Berlin than at the opening of the war.</p>

<p><b>Serbian Resistance to Austria.</b>&mdash;An Austrian attempt
to overwhelm Serbia in the first weeks of the
war met with disastrous failure. This was due to two
causes: (1) the brave resistance of the Serbian troops;
(2) the fact that the greater part of the Austrian forces
had to be used for defense against the Russian invaders
of Galicia. Serbia after severe fighting compelled the
Austrians to retreat beyond their own boundaries.
Early in September the Serbians took the offensive and
began an invasion of Austria-Hungary. This venture
failed, and before long Serbia was once more resisting
the enemy on her own soil. Belgrade fell into Austrian
hands on December 2. It did not long remain
in the possession of the conquerors. On the 14th, it
was regained by the Serbians, and the Austrian armies
once more expelled. The little Balkan kingdom seemed
to be holding her own.</p>

<p><b>Turkey Enters the War.</b>&mdash;In the years before the
war, Germany had carefully cultivated the friendship
of the Turkish government. By means of intrigue,
she had practically made herself master of that country,
particularly in military matters. The Turkish army
had been trained by Germans, and many of its officers
were Germans. Although at the opening of the war
Turkey declared herself neutral, she soon showed herself
an ally of the Central Powers. There is evidence
to show that as early as August 4 she had entered into
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 88]<a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a></span>a secret treaty with Germany. In October Turkey
startled the world by bombarding a Russian port on
the Black Sea and destroying French and Russian vessels<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 89]<a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a></span>
at Odessa. These acts were regarded by Russia
as acts of war. A few days later France and Great
Britain declared war on Turkey.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a href="images/088.png"><img src="images/thumb_088.png" width="500" height="318" alt="GERMAN COLONIES
and locations of
early naval engagements." title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">GERMAN COLONIES
and locations of
early naval engagements.</span>
</div>

<p>Germany welcomed the entrance of Turkey into the
war for two reasons. In the first place she expected
that the Mohammedans under English and French
rule, that is, those living in Morocco, Algeria, Egypt,
and India, would join the Turkish Sultan, the religious
head of the Mohammedan world, and engage in a
"Holy War" against Great Britain and France. In
this hope she was doomed to disappointment. In the
second place Germany rejoiced at the arrival of a new
enemy for Russia who might keep the Russians occupied
along their southern borders and so weaken their
efforts on other fronts.</p>

<p><b>German Colonies in the Pacific.</b>&mdash;During the first
four months of the war all of Germany's possessions
in the Pacific were lost to her. On the outbreak of the
war, Australia and New Zealand promptly organized
expeditionary forces which attacked and captured the
German colonies and coaling stations situated south
of the Equator. German Samoa, the first to be taken,
surrendered to the New Zealand expeditionary force
August 29. The other German possessions in the
South Pacific surrendered to the Australians.</p>

<p>England's ally, Japan, having entered the war August
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 90]<a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a></span>23, 1914, sent an expeditionary force which captured
and occupied the German islands in the North Pacific.
Kiaochow (kyou&acute;ch&#333;&acute;), Germany's only colony in China,
was captured by a combined Japanese and British force
early in November.</p>

<p>The loss of these colonies so early in the war interfered
seriously with German plans for a war on Allied
commerce by fast cruisers. In the absence of German
coaling stations, the only way such vessels could obtain
coal during a long raiding voyage, would be by the
chance capture of coal-laden vessels.</p>

<p><b>German Colonies in Africa.</b>&mdash;During the last quarter
century Germany had succeeded in getting control of
considerable territory in Africa. There were few German
colonists there. However, Germany hoped that
the Boers, who had recently fought a war with the
British, and had been defeated, would attempt to regain
their independence. In this case there was also
the possibility of capturing Cape Colony and Rhodesia
from the British. Much to the surprise and disgust
of Germany, the Boers promptly showed their loyalty
to Great Britain and aided in capturing the German
colonies.</p>

<p>The struggle for Germany's African colonies continued
for more than three years. Togo, a comparatively
small colony, was captured by French and British
troops shortly after the outbreak of the war. Under
the Boer leaders, Generals Smuts and Botha, German
Southwest Africa was conquered by July of 1915.
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 91]<a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a></span>Kamerun in West Africa was freed from German forces
in 1916. The final chapter in the fight for the German
colonies was written in December of 1917, when an army
from British South Africa, in co&ouml;peration with Belgian
forces, completed the conquest of German East Africa.</p>

<p><b>Germany's Fleet.</b>&mdash;When war was declared the
German fleet, which had cost the people of Germany
a billion and a half of dollars, was something less than
two thirds the strength of the British fleet. Germany's
task was to destroy the British fleet or to weaken it to
such an extent that it could no longer protect the British
trade in food and munitions from over seas, nor assure
the safe transport of troops from Great Britain or her
colonies to the various fronts.</p>

<p><b>The Work of the British Navy.</b>&mdash;The British navy
had two pieces of work to perform. In the first place
its aim was to destroy or bottle up in port the main
German fleet so that it should not be able to interfere
with the British plans for the war. In the second place
squadrons had to be sent out to search for and destroy
German squadrons or vessels that were far from home
ports at the outbreak of war or that were sent out to
raid British and neutral commerce.</p>

<p><b>Coast Protection.</b>&mdash;Both Great Britain and Germany
protected their coasts by laying fields of mines
in the sea so placed that they would float just under
water and arranged to explode on contact with the
hull of a ship. Through these mine fields carefully
hidden channels gave access to the different ports. So
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 92]<a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a></span>long as ships stayed in port or inside the fields of mines
they were safe from attack.</p>

<p><b>The Blockade of German Ports.</b>&mdash;In July, 1914, the
British navy had a grand review. When the review
was over, the war clouds were so threatening that the
vessels were not dismissed to their stations. At the
beginning of the war Great Britain announced a blockade
of German ports and assigned to her main fleet the
task of carrying out the blockade.</p>

<p><b>The Battle of Helgoland Bight.</b>&mdash;Hel&acute;goland is a
small island rising steeply out of the North Sea; it has
an area of one fifth of a square mile. It was ceded to
Germany by England about twenty years before the
war. Germany had fortified it and made it a sort of
German Gibraltar to protect her chief naval ports.
The Bight of Helgoland is the passage about eighteen
miles wide between the island and the German coast.
Here a portion of the British fleet engaged in patrol
or scout duty came in contact with a part of the German
fleet (August 28, 1914). The arrival of four fast British
battleships decided the contest. Germany lost three
cruisers and two destroyers, while every British vessel
returned to port, though some were badly battered.</p>

<p><b>German Commerce Raiders.</b>&mdash;A few days before
the outbreak of the war the German fleet in China
slipped out of port. The cruiser "Emden" was detached
for work in the Indian Ocean, and the rest of the
squadron raided over the Pacific. November 1, a
British squadron met the German ships near the coast
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 93]<a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a></span>of Chile. In a little over an hour two of the British
ships had been sunk and the remainder fled to the
south. Immediately on news of the defeat the British
Admiralty sent a squadron of seven powerful ships to
find and destroy the German squadron. The British
vessels stopped at the Falkland Islands to coal. The
next day the German ships appeared. When they saw
the strength of the British squadron they vainly attempted
to escape. In the battle that followed, four
German vessels were sunk. Of the two that escaped
one was, a few months later, interned in a United States
port and about the same time the other was destroyed.</p>

<p>The "Emden," after separating from the other warships,
cruised in the Indian Ocean for three months,
and was the most destructive of the German raiders.
She was finally located by an Australian cruiser. After
a fight the German captain drove his vessel on the
rocks to escape sinking. A lieutenant and forty men
who had landed to destroy a wireless station, seized a
schooner and escaped, landed on the coast of Arabia,
and finally made their way back to Germany.</p>

<p><b>Naval Situation at the Close of 1914.</b>&mdash;As a result
of the activities of the Allied fleets, the German navy
was shut up in port back of its mine fields, German
commerce raiders had, with a few exceptions,
been driven from the sea or destroyed, German merchant
vessels were laid up in neutral or German ports,
and the Allies were free to carry on the transport of
troops, munitions, and other supplies with practically
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 94]<a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a></span>no fear of interference from the enemy. "The British
ships, whether men-of-war or merchantmen, are upon
the sea, the German in their ports."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Suggestions for Study.</b>&mdash;1. Locate Metz, Cologne, Liege,
Namur, Lille, Verdun; the Meuse, the Marne, the Oise, the
Aisne; Lemberg, Warsaw, K&ouml;nigsberg. 2. Look at a large map
of Europe and by reference to the scale find out the following
distances: Metz to Paris; Cologne to Paris (via Liege); Verdun
to Berlin; Verdun to Strassburg; Liege to Paris; Warsaw to
Berlin. What is the length of the Belgian coast-line; of the
Dutch coast-line; of the Franco-German frontier? 3. Collect
pictures and charts illustrative of trench warfare, and of devastated
areas of Belgium and France. 4. Explain fully the influence
of geography upon the campaigns of 1914. 5. Define
neutrality; guarantee; treaty. 6. On an outline map of Europe
indicate the countries fighting against Germany at the close of
1914. Indicate those fighting on the side of Germany at that
time. Indicate the date when each of these countries entered the
war. Draw a line showing the farthest German advance into
France, and the farthest Russian advance into Germany and
Austria (map, page <a href="#Page_124">124</a>). 7. What might have been the consequences
if the Belgians had not resisted the German invasion?
8. Describe the German effort to reach the French coast in
1914. What would have been the probable consequences of its
success? 9. What was the purpose of the, English blockade of
Germany? How did this blockade affect the rights of neutrals?
Find out what the United States government did in the matter.</p>

on the western front at the close of 1914 continued with
little change during the year 1915. There were indeed
many contests which, on account of the men involved
and the casualties, would in previous wars have been
considered major engagements; but in spite of great
preparations neither side was able to make much impression
upon the entrenched line of the enemy. From
the sea to the Swiss border two apparently impregnable
lines of trenches faced each other.</p>

<p>German ingenuity and barbarity were shown in two
new forms of warfare introduced during this year.
Poison gas was first used, contrary to the terms of the
Hague Conventions, against the Allied line on April
22, 1915. It brought on the most horrible forms
of suffering and torture, and compelled a temporary
withdrawal of the French and English from trenches
near Ypres (eepr). Later, masks were used as a preventive
of gas poisoning. Eventually the Allies were
forced to adopt the use of poisonous gases in bombs
and shells in order to fight the Germans with their own
weapon. The other innovation was the "flame-thrower,"
an apparatus which threw a flame of burning liquid or
gas far ahead of the troops. This has never been
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 96]<a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a></span>widely used by the Germans, because it proved almost
as dangerous to themselves as it was to their opponents.
A sharpshooter's bullet or a piece of shell might pierce
the apparatus and the containers and produce dangerous
results among the Germans.</p>

<p><b>The Gallipoli Campaign.</b>&mdash;In the east the year
opened with an attempt on the part of the Allies to force
the Dardanelles with their fleets and take possession of
the city of Constantinople. The campaign gets its
name from the peninsula of Gallip&acute;oli, the European
shore of the Dardanelles. In February the campaign
opened with a naval attack. The Turkish fortifications,
however, were strong enough to defeat a purely naval
attempt and the Allied fleets met with heavy losses.
It has been stated since that had the Allies continued
the attack one more day the Turks would have had to
yield, as their ammunition was nearly exhausted. In
April troops were landed on the peninsula to aid in the
attack. The landing was accomplished at a terrible
cost of life. Siege operations were then begun against
the Turkish and German forces defending the peninsula.
Month after month the fighting continued, but nothing
worth while was accomplished. Finally, in January of
the next year, the campaign was abandoned. It had
cost the Allies heavily in money and lives, and its
failure had lost to them the respect of the hesitating
nations of southeastern Europe, Bulgaria and Greece.</p>

<p><b>The War on the Russian Border.</b>&mdash;Along the Russian
frontier also the Allied cause met with serious reverses.
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 97]<a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a></span>The year had opened favorably with the Russians in
control of most of Galicia. In March the great Galician
fortress of Przemysl, which had successfully withstood
the attacks of the Russians the previous autumn, was
compelled to surrender.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in January, Russia once more attempted
to carry out the other part of her general plan, the
invasion of East Prussia. The Russian troops succeeded
as before in entering the coveted territory, this time
crossing the troublesome lake region while the waters
were frozen. Soon, however, the invaders met with a
decisive defeat. In the Battle of the Mazurian Lakes,
General Von Hindenburg took 100,000 Russian prisoners;
the number of killed and wounded Russian soldiers is
said to have been 150,000. The Russians hurriedly
retreated from German soil.</p>

<p>The time had now come for the Germans and Austrians
definitely to assume the offensive. A strategic blow in
Galicia imperiled the whole Russian front and compelled
a general retreat of the Russian armies in Galicia
and Poland. In June both Przemysl and Lemberg
were recaptured by the Central Powers. By September
all of Russian Poland had been conquered. Russia had
lost 65,000 square miles of thickly populated territory.
But the land was so thoroughly plundered by the German
conquerors that many of the people died of starvation.</p>

<p><b>Bulgaria Enters the War.</b>&mdash;The sympathies of the
Bulgarian government had been with the Central
Powers from the beginning of the war. Bulgaria had
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 98]<a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a></span>not forgiven the neighboring Balkan states for their
treatment of her in the second Balkan war (1913).
Against Serbia her feeling was particularly bitter.
The Allied disaster at Gallipoli and the military successes
of Germany and Austria in Poland and Galicia
in the spring and summer of 1915 led the Bulgarians to
believe that now was the time for them to strike. In
October Bulgaria declared war upon Serbia, thus definitely
taking her stand as an ally of the Central Powers.</p>

<p>Bulgaria's entrance into the war was followed by
simultaneous invasions of Serbia from Austria and
from Bulgaria. Under these blows the Serbians were
crushed. Together with her neighbor and ally, brave
little Montenegro, Serbia was overrun by her enemies.
The cruelties inflicted upon the Serbian population by
the invading Bulgars are said to have been fully as
horrible as those which had taken place during the
conquest of Belgium in 1914 and of Poland in 1915.</p>

<p>There was serious danger that the government of
Greece would follow the lead of Bulgaria and also enter
the war on the side of the Central Powers. This was
prevented by two things. In the first place, a majority
of the Greek people favored the cause of the Allies and
were opposed to Bulgaria. In the second place, the
Allies promptly landed an army at Salonica. Later on,
they removed Constantine, the pro-German king of
Greece, and placed his son Alexander upon the throne.</p>

<p><b>The East at the Close of 1915.</b>&mdash;On the eastern
front 1915 had been a year of failure. The Gallipoli
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 99]<a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a></span>campaign had been a humiliation for the Allies. The
Russians had been driven from Russian Poland and
from the Austrian province of Galicia. Bulgaria had
joined the Central Powers, linking Austria-Hungary
with Turkey. Serbia, the country whose quarrel had
been the occasion of the whole world struggle, had been
conquered by the enemies of the Allies.</p>

<p><b>Italy Enters the War.</b>&mdash;In May, 1915, Italy declared
war upon Austria, and more than a year later upon
Germany. Her reasons for this action were: (1) her old
enmity toward Austria; (2) her desire to annex the
neighboring territory inhabited by Italians, but ruled
by Austria; and (3) her feeling that Austria was opposed
to Italian interests in the Balkans.</p>

<p>Italy entered the war with vigor although at a great
disadvantage. When the northern Italian lands were
freed from Austrian rule in 1866, Austria kept the highlands
and mountain passes, from which she could easily
descend upon the Italian lowlands. Now that war was
begun, the Italians were compelled to force their way up
the heights and against the fire from well-protected
Austrian forts. Here upon the dizzy peaks of the Alps,
or the icy surfaces of glaciers, or the rocky mountain
sides, warfare has been more spectacular and has called
for more daring and recklessness than anywhere else.
Slides of rock and avalanches of ice sometimes have
been the ammunition of armies. During the year the
Italians made some progress and by December occupied
positions well within the Austrian frontier; but no
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 100]<a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a></span>decisive battle had been fought or important city or
fortress occupied.</p>

<p><b>Allied Control of the Sea.</b>&mdash;Throughout 1915&mdash;as
in the preceding and the following years&mdash;the Allies
maintained their control of the ocean. As a result of a
proclamation declaring the North Sea a military area,
and the more strict enforcement of the proclamation
against sending contraband articles to Germany, the
blockade against the Central Powers was more tightly
drawn.</p>

<p>This seriously affected the commerce of the United
States, not only with Germany but with neutral countries,
such as Holland or Sweden, that could easily
transship to Germany the supplies received. Neutral
vessels were stopped and taken into Allied ports, there
to be detained sometimes for long periods until a decision
was reached as to the legality of their traffic. Moreover,
the expense of this detention was laid upon the owners
of the vessel and cargo. These acts brought forth a
series of protests by our government against the policy
of the Allies. The correspondence continued with
varying results until the United States entered the war.</p>

<p><b>Forced Decrease of Neutral Trade with Germany.</b>&mdash;Neutral
countries adjoining Germany had been making
huge profits by selling their food and other products to
Germany, replacing their stores with material imported
from over seas. As part of the preparation for a long
war, the Allies blocked the renewal of neutral stocks of
goods. The neutral countries complained vigorously,
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 101]<a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a></span>but they soon cut down their trade with Germany since
they were no longer able to replenish their stock of
food, rubber, metals, and other supplies.</p>

<p><b>Submarine Warfare.</b>&mdash;In 1914, when the war broke
out, Germany is said to have had but four seaworthy
submarines. It is difficult to believe that she had so
few, but it is certain that she did not have so many as
either England, France, or Russia. German naval
authorities were not convinced of the value of the submarine
in war.</p>

<p>However, about a month after the war began, a
German submarine torpedoed a British cruiser, and,
within a few minutes, two others that had gone to
assist the first. Germany, now realizing the value of
the new weapon, began the construction of a numerous
fleet of underwater boats, or U-boats. But against
war ships, properly defended by guns and other means,
they proved of little avail after all. Toward the end of
the year, Admiral von Tirpitz, head of the German
navy, hinted at an extension of the use of submarines
to attack merchant ships.</p>

<p>Soon numbers of the submarines made their way to
the waters surrounding the British Isles, where they
torpedoed merchant vessels taking food and supplies
to Great Britain and France. The vessels sunk were
chiefly British, though some were neutral.</p>

<p><b>Protection against Submarines.</b>&mdash;Large war ships
were protected from submarines by keeping them in a
mine-protected area until there was need for them at
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 102]<a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a></span>sea. At sea they were protected largely by the patrol
and scouting operations carried on by lighter and faster
vessels. To reduce the danger to merchant vessels from
submarines, harbors and sea lanes were protected by
mines and by great nets made of heavy wire cables.
The seas in the immediate vicinity of Great Britain
were patrolled by thousands of small, swift vessels
constantly in search of U-boats.</p>

<p><b>Attempted Blockade of Great Britain.</b>&mdash;In February,
1915, Germany declared a blockade of the British Isles.
Under an actual blockade she would have the right to
prevent neutral vessels from trading with Great Britain.
But inasmuch as it was not possible to take seized
neutral ships to German ports, the submarines would
sink them, often without providing for the safety of the
passengers and crews. The ultimate object of this course
of action was so to reduce the world's shipping as to
make it impossible for Great Britain to be supplied with
the food or other materials that would enable her to
carry on the war. This method of warfare, however,
was contrary to the well established rules of international
law. Against it the United States and other
neutrals made vigorous protests.</p>

<p><b>The Lusitania.</b>&mdash;The most notable loss by submarine
attack was that of the "Lusitania," sunk without
warning off the coast of Ireland on May 7, 1915. Nearly
twelve hundred lives were lost, including many women
and children. One hundred and fourteen of those lost
were Americans. An advertisement had been inserted
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 103]<a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a></span>in the papers warning passengers not to travel on Allied
ships, but no one believed that Germany would go so
far in violation of international law as to torpedo, without
warning, a passenger vessel carrying civilians of neutral
as well as of warring nations. The people of the whole
civilized world were horrified by the deed. Germany's
attitude is shown by the fact that medals were struck
commemorating the act, and the commander of the
submarine was rewarded.</p>

<p>President Wilson wrote a series of notes to the German
government insisting that Germany conduct her warfare
in accordance with international law. This resulted
in a promise by the German minister to the United
States, that liners would not be sunk by German submarines
without warning and without safety to the
lives of noncombatants, provided that the liners did
not try to escape or offer resistance.</p>

<p><b>Raids on Coast Towns.</b>&mdash;Several times in 1914
German vessels managed to escape through the cordon
of Allied ships. They proceeded to the east coast of
England and bombarded defenseless fishing ports and
watering places such as Yarmouth, Whitby, and Scarborough.
These raids had no military effect, but they
resulted in the killing or wounding of hundreds of
women, children, and old men. They were undertaken
for the purpose of terrorizing the civilian population of
England in order to arouse a desire for peace. In
January, 1915, a German squadron attempting a similar
raid was intercepted and defeated by British war ships.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 104]<a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a></span><b>Zeppelins.</b>&mdash;At the outset Germany had great faith
in the usefulness of her immense dirigible balloons, or
Zep&acute;pelins, as they are commonly called. In the attack
on Belgium, they were used for observation, incidentally
dropping a few bombs on Antwerp. Early in 1915,
Zeppelins made their appearance over England, bombing
many of the smaller towns and villages, as well as
London. Such raids might have some effect on the
war if they were directed toward munition plants,
railway stations, or naval depots. The Germans,
however, generally contented themselves with attacks
on defenseless residential towns and cities. Up to
October, 1917, there were thirty-four such raids, resulting
in the death of nearly one thousand persons and the
wounding of three times as many. The result on the
military situation was practically zero, except to increase
the British determination to see the war through.</p>

<p>Later the protection afforded Great Britain by anti-aircraft
guns and especially by airplanes, made it highly
dangerous for Zeppelins to continue their raids. Many
of them were destroyed. The later raids were made by
squadrons of airplanes which had greater chances of
escape. German air raiders found it increasingly difficult
to get past the defenses, and in 1918 the raids on
England became infrequent.</p>

<p><b>Allied Retaliation.</b>&mdash;For a long time the Allies
refused to retaliate by bombing unfortified towns in
Germany, but finally they decided to do so. The
immediate results were a protest from Germany that
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 105]<a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a></span>the Allies were violating international law, and a petition
to the German authorities from the towns in western
Germany, asking that air raids on places not in the
military area should be stopped, so that the German
cities should not be bombed in retaliation. Nearly all
such Allied air raids, however, were directed against
railroads, munition factories, and other objects of
military importance.</p>

<p><b>The Allies Organize for a Long War.</b>&mdash;When Lord
Kitchener, the great British general, predicted that the
war would last at least three years, hardly any one
believed him. It was thought that the cost of a modern
war would be so great that nations would not be able
to stand the strain for more than a few months. When
the Allies realized that Kitchener was right, they prepared
for a long struggle. The munition factories in
all the countries were reorganized, and the output of
war material was increased many fold, more being
produced in a few days than had formerly been produced
in a year. Great Britain and France appointed
ministers of munitions whose sole work was to see that
the armies were supplied with guns, ammunition, and
other fighting needs.</p>

<p>The people in the British overseas dominions remained
loyal, and sent hundreds of thousands of
soldiers to the battle fronts in order to protect the
mother country from threatened defeat. To secure
still greater co&ouml;peration throughout the British Empire,
the prime ministers of the self-governing colonies
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 106]<a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a></span>were invited to places in the British imperial war
conferences.</p>

<h3>THE WAR IN 1916</h3>


<p><b>"They Shall Not Pass!"</b>&mdash;Early in 1916 the Germans
began a furious attack on the strong French
position at Verdun. This point was a highly important
one for the French, because if it were captured by the
enemy, he could make flank attacks upon their adjoining
lines and perhaps compel a general retreat. The Germans
had long been massing materials and men for the
greatest military offensive which the world had ever
seen. Twenty thousand men were placed on each mile
of the front for a distance of twenty-five miles, while
hundreds of thousands more were held in reserve.
Thousands of guns of all sizes were brought up for the
attack. Under the command of the German crown
prince, the German people and the whole world were
to be shown that the German army was still invincible.</p>

<p>Beginning on February 21, the titanic struggle around
Verdun continued until July, when the attacks and
counter-attacks were gradually suspended. In the
early attacks the French were driven in from advanced
positions, and then the Germans charged the heavily
protected woodlands and hills. In massed formation
they advanced in the face of artillery, machine-gun,
and rifle fire of the heaviest character. The first waves
were mown down like grain; but other troops, and
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 108]<a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a></span>still others climbed over the bodies of their dead comrades.
Never since the world began had such slaughter
been seen.</p>

<p>During the intervals between the infantry attacks
the French troops were subjected to an unprecedented
artillery fire. Suffering under a strain such as armies
had never hitherto known, the French patriots yet held
true to their watchword,&mdash;"They shall not pass."
General P&eacute;tain (p&#257;-t&#259;n&acute;), in a stirring address, said to
his entrenched heroes, "Courage, we'll get them!"
("<i>Courage, on les aura!</i>"), and this phrase became the
Verdun battle-cry. Try as the Germans would, from
every possible point, they could not break through the
living wall of Frenchmen. A little ground was won
here and there, but before the end of the year
nearly all had been retaken by the French. At a frightful
cost the German crown prince and his military advisers
had put their fighting machine to the test, and
it had failed. A half million men, killed, wounded, or
prisoners, were lost to the Germans before they ceased
their attacks at this point.</p>

<p><b>The Battle of the Somme.</b>&mdash;In July, 1916, while the
Verdun struggle was still undetermined, the French
and British troops began an advance on the German
line along the river Somme (som). Exceedingly heavy
artillery attacks first battered down the enemy defenses,
and then the infantry went "over the top." During
the long course of the Battle of the Somme (July 1 to
November 17) the Allies advanced on a front of twenty
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 109]<a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a></span>miles to a maximum depth of about nine miles. Slowly,
and at great expense of ammunition and men on both
sides, the Allied progress had been won. They had
failed to break through the German line, but they had
shown how it might gradually be pushed back. And
they had relieved the important position of Verdun
from further severe attacks, because German forces were
needed to the westward.</p>

<p>In the course of this battle, on September 15, the
British first used their most original military machines&mdash;the
"tanks." Thereafter these armored cruisers of
the land were to play an increasingly important part
along the western front.</p>

<p><b>Increased Use of Aircraft.</b>&mdash;Aircraft, too, were
every day becoming more valuable. In the first year
of the war airplanes were used mainly for observation
purposes: to find the location of enemy forts, trenches,
troops, and batteries; and to direct the fire of the
aviator's own batteries. Hundreds of photographs were
taken by the airmen, rapidly developed, and within
thirty minutes the staff officers could be seen studying
them with microscopes to determine what changes had
taken place within the enemy's lines. Anchored balloons,
too, were used for similar purposes.</p>

<p>Airplane construction and use developed more rapidly
than any other feature in the war. After the observation
machines, came the battle-planes, whose first
purpose was to clear the way and protect the observation
planes. Later, heavy machines for bombing expeditions
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 110]<a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a></span>were constructed; and squadrons of airplanes now took
part in every battle, preceding the attacking party, and
firing with machine-guns
and
bombs upon the
enemy's trenches
or his massed
troops back of
the line.</p>

<p><b>The Russians
Invade Turkey in
Asia.</b>&mdash;In the
early months of
1916 Russian
troops met with
success in an offensive
in the part
of Turkey south
of the Caucasus.
This territory,
known as Arme&acute;nia,
is inhabited
by a Christian
population who
for many years
had been the victims of Turkish persecutions; half a
million were cruelly exterminated after Turkey allied
herself with Germany in 1914. The Russians advanced
steadily, inflicting serious defeats upon the Turkish forces.
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 111]<a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a></span>In February they took possession of Erz&acute;erum, a strongly
fortified city of Armenia. The capture of this point
was of importance because it was a step in the plan for
co&ouml;peration with the British armies which were pushing
their way north from the region of the Persian Gulf.
It had the further important result of interrupting
Turkish plans for an invasion of Egypt by way of the
Isthmus of Suez, as Turkey was compelled to concentrate
her power for the defense of her own territory.</p>

<p>In April, Treb&acute;izond, the most important city on the
Turkish shore of the Black Sea, surrendered to the
invading Russian army. The Russians, supported by
fleets along the coast, had made the defense of the city
impossible. The fall of Trebizond was a very serious
blow to the power of Turkey in Asia Minor.</p>

<p><b>The Campaign in Mesopotamia.</b>&mdash;Part of the Allied
plan in the east was for the junction of Russian armies
operating from the region of the Caucasus with British
troops from the land around the Persian Gulf. While
the Russians, as we have seen, were making a noteworthy
success of their part of this program, the British
had not been so fortunate. Their plan was to take
possession of Mesopotamia, the valley of the Tigris-Euphrates,
and occupy its capital, the famous city of
Bagdad. General Townshend with an insufficient force
had begun his march up the Tigris River the year before
and in March, 1915, had occupied the stronghold of
Kut-el-Ama&acute;ra, about 100 miles below Bagdad. Here
later he was besieged by a Turkish army. A Russian
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 112]<a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a></span>army on the way from Erzerum and an English relief
force from the south failed to reach the place in time,
and April 29, 1916, General Townshend was forced by
starvation to surrender.</p>

<p><b>Russian Successes in Austria.</b>&mdash;During the summer
months the Russians under the command of one of
their greatest leaders, General Bru&acute;silov, renewed their
offensive against the border lands of Austria-Hungary.
It looked for a while as if the disasters of 1915 in this
region were about to be redeemed. On a wide front
extending from the Prip&acute;et marshes in eastern Poland
all the way to Bukowina (boo-ko-vee&acute;nah), the Austrian
province southeast of Galicia, the Russian armies advanced.
They invaded Galicia and took hundreds of
thousands of Austrian prisoners. Austria was compelled
to transfer troops from her Italian front. The
year 1916 closed with the Russians in a decidedly more
favorable military position than they had occupied a
year before.</p>

<p><b>Roumania in the War.</b>&mdash;Roumania had long looked
forward to an extension of her boundaries to include all
the Roumanians of southeastern Europe. Across the
border, in southeastern Hungary, were more than two
million Roumanians living in the large region known as
Transylvania. The annexation of Transylvania was
one of the greatest ambitions of Roumanian leaders.
In August, 1916, encouraged by the promises of Russia,
her powerful neighbor and protector, Roumania entered
the war on the side of the Allies.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 113]<a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a></span>On her western front Roumania could easily defend
herself from invasion because of strong mountain barriers.
Her point of danger was the Bulgarian boundary
between the Danube and the Black Sea. Here she
should have concentrated her strength for defense
against the Bulgarian forces or even for an offensive
into Bulgaria. Instead she sent most of her armies
west into Transylvania. Presently a strong force of
Germans and Bulgarians crossed the border into southeastern
Roumania (the Dobrudja) and marched north
in a resistless offensive. Meanwhile the Roumanians
in Transylvania, far from their base of supplies, had
advanced too fast for safety. Moreover, they suffered
from a shortage of ammunition, probably caused by
the failure of certain pro-German Russian officials to
co&ouml;perate with the Roumanians as they had promised.
A large German army attacked the Roumanian forces
and drove them back with heavy losses to their own
borders. The boundaries were then crossed by the invaders
and the greater part of the country occupied.
This disaster brought enormous advantages to the
enemy. The battle front of the Central Powers was
shortened by five hundred miles, the oil and wheat
fields which constitute the chief wealth of Roumania
fell into their hands, and their communications with
Turkey were materially strengthened.</p>

<p><b>The Italian Front.</b>&mdash;The winter of 1915-1916 was
uncommonly severe in the Alps; snow thirty feet deep
lay on some of the passes, and military operations were
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 114]<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a></span>brought almost to a standstill. During the spring the
Austrians made preparations for a great offensive against
Italy, collecting over a third of a million of men and
enormous stores of provisions and munitions. During
May and June, 1916, this Austrian force drove back
the Italians from their advanced positions in the Trentino
valley. It seemed that the enemy would enter the
valley of the Po and capture the cities of the most prosperous
part of Italy. But the farther the Austrian
army advanced, the more difficult it was to bring supplies
up the narrow Alpine valleys. Meantime, on the
eastern frontier the Russians began their great drive
into Austrian territory. There was nothing for the
Austrians to do but retire from the Trentino front.
This they did with the loss of one third of their force,
and of great quantities of war material.</p>

<p>The Italians now took the offensive, not only on the
Trentino, but also on their eastern frontier, where,
the year before, they had begun an advance toward the
"unredeemed" territory around Trieste (map, page <a href="#Page_50">50</a>).
The Ison&acute;zo River was crossed and after months of
warfare the city and fortresses of Gorizia (go-r&icirc;t&acute;s&icirc;-a)
were occupied (August 9, 1916). From this point the
Italians continued slowly, overcoming great difficulties,
on their way toward Trieste.</p>

<p><b>The Battle of Jutland, May 31, 1916.</b>&mdash;A minor
division of the British fleet under Admiral Beatty was
scouting in the neighborhood of Jutland (the peninsula
of Denmark). The main German fleet came out to
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 115]<a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a></span>attack it. The small British squadron, instead of
withdrawing, gave battle to the whole German high
seas fleet. After the fighting had gone on for several
hours in fog and mist, the British grand fleet approached,
but night came on before a decision was reached. During
the night the German fleet retired back of the
defenses of mines and shore batteries. In the battle
the British fleet had lost three battle cruisers and fifteen
or sixteen other vessels. The German losses were not
completely published but were certainly heavier. The
Germans claimed a victory, and a general holiday was
ordered that all might celebrate. Nevertheless, the
British vessels were on the scene the next morning
picking up survivors, while the German fleet has not
(up to the present writing) come out of harbor in
order that it might try to repeat its so-called victory.</p>

<p><b>Submarine Warfare.</b>&mdash;During the year 1916 Germans
continued with increasing success their policy of sinking
merchant vessels, neutral and enemy. Out of a total of
nearly 4,000,000 tons of shipping destroyed from the
beginning of the war to January 1, 1917, more than
half was lost during 1916. Occasional loss of life also
caused much doubt on the part of our government as to
whether Germany was keeping her pledge to safeguard
the lives of noncombatants on torpedoed liners.</p>

<p>When a passenger steamer, the "Sussex," plying
between England and France, was torpedoed without
warning (March 24, 1916), eighty of the passengers
were killed or injured, two of the latter being Americans.
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 116]<a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a></span>Germany at first said that one of her submarines had
torpedoed a vessel in the vicinity, but not the "Sussex."
The finding of fragments of a German torpedo on the
"Sussex" after it was brought into port conclusively
proved that the Germans were responsible, and that
Germany had broken her promise. President Wilson
addressed a note to the German government, stating
that he would sever diplomatic relations with it unless
Germany should both declare and effect an abandonment
of her unlawful methods of submarine warfare. Thereupon
the German government gave a written pledge
that merchant ships "shall not be sunk without warning
and without saving human lives, unless these ships
attempt to escape or offer resistance." This pledge was
given on the condition that the United States should
demand that Great Britain observe certain (disputed)
rules of international law; but our government refused
to agree that Germany's respect for our neutral rights
should be made to depend on the conduct of other
nations. President Wilson thus made clear his intention
to sever diplomatic relations if Germany's pledge should
be withdrawn or violated.</p>

<p><b>Conscription in Great Britain.</b>&mdash;The British government
had kept up its army by volunteering. The need
of an army of five million could not depend on this
plan. A conscription bill therefore was passed making
all males between certain ages liable for military service.
Ireland was excepted from the provisions of this act.</p>

<p><b>Sinn Fein Rebellion.</b>&mdash;Some of the more radical
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 117]<a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a></span>among the Irish Home Rule party had formed an organization
known as the Sinn Fein (shin f&#257;n), an Irish
phrase which means "for ourselves." Their aim was
to make Ireland an independent nation. The leaders of
this group got into correspondence with persons in
Germany and were promised military assistance if they
would rebel against England. The rebellion broke out
April 24, 1916, without the promised help from Germany.
For several days the rebels held some of the principal
buildings in Dublin. After much bloodshed the rebellion
was put down, and Sir Roger Casement, one of those
who had been in communication with Germany, was
executed for treason.</p>

<h3>THE WAR IN 1917</h3>


<p><b>The Western Front.</b>&mdash;During the winter of 1916-1917
there was little infantry warfare in France, although
the heavy guns kept up their cannonades. In the
spring of 1917 the Allies planned a great drive on the
enemy positions in the valley of the Somme. But in
March the Germans began a general retirement to a
more easily defended line&mdash;the so-called Hindenburg
line&mdash;on a front of one hundred miles, from Arras
(ar-rahss&acute;) to Soissons (swah-sawn&acute;)<a name="FNanchor_1_3" id="FNanchor_1_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>. Completely destroying
the villages, churches, castles, vineyards, and
orchards, they left a desolate waste behind them. In
this retreat the Germans gave up French territory to
the extent of thirteen hundred square miles.</p>

<p>The German retirement was closely followed by British
and French troops. Great courage was shown by
Canadian troops in the taking of Vimy Ridge on April 9.
In the following month many attacks were made by the
British and French, which resulted in the taking of
nearly 50,000 prisoners and large quantities of munitions,
and the breaking through the Hindenburg line in one
place. During the summer and fall the Allied attacks
continued to win small territorial gains. The artillery
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 119]<a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a></span>fire was very heavy during all this time. During a
period of three weeks the French city of Rheims (reemz
or r&#259;nss) alone, with its magnificent cathedral almost in
ruins, was bombarded with 65,000 large caliber German
shells.</p>

<p>Two very important ridges, from which artillery
could reach German positions, were taken during the
heavy fighting in November. The French forced a
retreat of the Germans over a thirteen-mile front and
occupied the ridge known as Chemin des Dames
(shm&#259;n d&#257; dahm); while the Canadians secured Passchendaele
(pahss-ken-d&#277;l&acute;&#257;) Ridge.</p>

<p>Late in the year the British introduced a new method
of warfare. Instead of beginning their attack with a
great bombardment lasting many hours and thus
indicating to the enemy the approximate time and place
of attack, they sent over the front a large number of
"tanks" which broke through the barbed wire entanglements
and opened the way for the infantry. By this
means the British successfully surprised the enemy in
the battle of Cambrai (cahn-br&#277;&acute;; November 20 to
December 13). Unfortunately they could not hold
most of the land occupied,&mdash;which was lost later in
the battle,&mdash;but they did show the possibility of
breaking the old deadlock of trench righting. The new
method was to be used by both sides during the
campaigns of the following year.</p>

<p><b>The War in the Air.</b>&mdash;During this year warfare in
the air continued to advance. Guynemer (geen-m&#277;r&acute;),
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 120]<a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a></span>the great French ace, who was lost on September 11,
had to his credit the destruction of fifty-four enemy
machines. The increase in the number of airplanes led
to the grouping of large numbers into regular formations
(escadrilles), sometimes composed of over a hundred
planes. Each year showed a steady increase in the
effectiveness of this kind of warfare. In 1916 a total of
611 enemy machines had been destroyed or damaged by
the Allied forces. In 1917 the French destroyed forty-three
in twenty-four hours; and the British brought
down thirty-one enemy planes in one combat. In a
single week in 1918 the Allies destroyed 339 German
planes. On one day, October 9, 1918, three hundred
and fifty airplanes were sent forth by the American
army in a single bombing expedition.</p>

<p><b>The Russian Revolution.</b>&mdash;In 1917 the Allied cause
received a heavy blow through the collapse of the
Russian government. Long before the war there had
been parties in Russia which desired to do away with
the autocratic government of the Czar and substitute
some sort of representative system which would give to
the people a voice in the management of their affairs.
These reforming parties did not agree among themselves
as to the kind of government they wished to set up;
their ideas extended from limited monarchy of the
English type, all the way to anarchy, which means no
government at all. In 1905 the Czar met the wishes of
the reformers to the extent of establishing the Duma, a
sort of representative assembly or parliament, which
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 121]<a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a></span>should help in making the laws. The Duma, however,
was never given any real authority, and as time passed
those who believed in Russian democracy became more
and more dissatisfied.</p>

<p>During the war the Germans by means of bribery and
plotting did all they could to weaken the authority
of the Russian government. There existed, moreover,
much corruption and disloyalty among high Russian officials.
As the war dragged on a shortage of food added
to the general discontent. By the early months of 1917,
conditions were very bad indeed, and dissatisfied crowds
gathered in the streets of Petrograd. Hunger and
hardship had made them desperate, and they refused to
disperse until the government should do something
to relieve the situation. Regiments of soldiers were
summoned to fire upon the crowd. They refused to
do so and finally joined the mob. Thus began the
Russian Revolution.</p>

<p>At a meeting of the revolutionists a group of soldiers
and working men was selected to call upon the Duma
and ask that body to form a temporary government.
Another committee was sent to inform Nicholas II
that he was deposed. Messages were sent to the armies
to notify the generals that there was no longer a Russian
Empire and that they were to take their orders thereafter
from the representatives of the Russian people. Within
a few days the revolution was complete. On March 15,
the Czar signed a paper giving up the throne of Russia.
Moderate reformers were placed in charge of the different
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 122]<a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a></span>departments of the government. The new government
was recognized by the United States, Great Britain,
France, and Italy. It looked as if the revolution had
established a free government for Russia and that
thenceforth, as a democratic nation, she would fight
better than ever by the side of her allies. In all the
Russian provinces, elections were called for choosing
delegates to an assembly that should make a new
constitution for Russia.</p>

<p><b>Russia under Kerensky.</b>&mdash;Meanwhile the extreme
socialists began at once to make trouble for the new
government. These men for the most part owned no
property and wanted all wealth equally divided among
the entire population. They considered the new government
as tyrannical as that of the Czar had been. They
also favored an immediate peace. Chief among the
moderate leaders during this period was Alexander
Keren&acute;sky. He saw the necessity of keeping the revolution
within bounds. For a while he was strong enough
to maintain a moderate government in spite of the
opposition of the extreme socialists. The Germans,
meanwhile, through spies and secret agents, had been
spreading among the Russian soldiers the idea that
Germany was really their friend and that it was to their
interest to stop fighting and retreat. Kerensky personally
visited the battle front in Galicia, and for a time
by means of his rousing speeches to the soldiers kept up
their fighting spirit. New advances were made, the
Germans and Austrians being driven back many miles.
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 123]<a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a></span>Lemberg itself seemed about to fall once more into the
hands of the Russians. But this success was only
temporary. Owing to the shortage of ammunition and
the rapid spread of peace sentiments among the troops,
the Russian army became disorganized and retreated
from Galicia.</p>

<p><b>The Bolsheviki.</b>&mdash;Bolsheviki (b&#333;l-sh&#277;v&acute;e-kee) is the
name given to the extreme socialistic party in Russia.
From the beginning they had opposed the control of
affairs by the moderate revolutionists under Kerensky.
At last, in the fall of 1917, helped by the depression
caused by the German advance and by the strikes and
food riots which once more broke out in the capital,
they succeeded in winning over to their side the
Petrograd garrison and the navy, and drove Kerensky
from the city (November 7). Their revolt was led
by two of the most extreme members of the party,
Lenine and Trotzky, who had at their disposal large
sums of money furnished by Germany.</p>

<p>No sooner were the Bolsheviki in control than they
announced themselves in favor of an immediate peace.
They proclaimed that all the land should at once be
divided among the peasants. When the new representative
assembly met to make a constitution, it was
found to be too moderate to suit the Bolshevik leaders,
who dispersed it before it could accomplish anything.
The rule of Lenine and Trotzky promised to be even
more tyrannical than anything that had preceded it in
Russia.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<span class="caption">EUROPEAN BATTLE FRONTS End of 1917</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 124]<a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a></span>Meanwhile the Bolsheviki had arranged for an armistice
with Germany with a view toward immediate
negotiations for peace. This arrangement for the
cessation of military operations became effective December
7. In spite of its provisions, however, the Germans,
who had taken Riga (ree&acute;ga) in September, continued
their advance into Russian territory. By the close of
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 125]<a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a></span>1917 peace negotiations were in progress between Russia
and her enemies. Russia under Bolshevik control had
definitely deserted her allies.</p>

<p><b>The British in Mesopotamia.</b>&mdash;It will be remembered
that the Allied war plans in 1916 had included the
junction of Russian armies operating from the Caucasus
with British troops advancing north from the Persian
Gulf. After the disaster at Kut-el-Amara the British
still held the territory about the mouth of the Tigris.
In January, 1917, they began a new advance up the
river in the direction of Bagdad. This time their efforts
proved successful. In February, Kut-el-Amara was
retaken from the Turks, and on March 11 the British
entered the city of Bagdad. They also continued their
advance a considerable distance along the Bagdad
Railway and occupied much of the Euphrates valley.</p>

<p>Still more important victories would probably have
resulted from this campaign had it not been for the
outbreak of the Russian revolution. This had the
effect of weakening Russian military co&ouml;peration, and
finally of removing Russia entirely from the war, leaving
to Great Britain alone the task of dealing with the
Turkish armies in Asia. But the British kept their
hold on the city of Bagdad, thus checkmating the German
scheme of a Berlin-Bagdad railway and protecting
India from any offensive on this side.</p>

<p><b>The Palestine Campaign.</b>&mdash;The year 1917 witnessed
still another military success for the British in Asia.
The Turks had made several attempts to seize the
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 126]<a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a></span>Suez Canal and so inflict a serious blow against the
communications of the Allies with the Far East. To
remove, if possible, the danger of further threats against
this vital spot, the English at last decided upon an
offensive in that region. Early in 1917, the British
advance began. During January and February important
positions on the Sinai peninsula were seized.
This success was followed by a slow progress north into
Palestine. The resistance of the Turks was powerful
and the British met with serious reverses. The terrible
heat of the summer months further held up their operations.
In the fall, however, the advance was resumed
and a number of towns in the Holy Land fell into the
hands of the British. In November, Jaffa, the seaport
of Jerusalem, was taken. All the Turkish positions
around the Holy City were carried by storm, and
on December 10 Jerusalem surrendered to General
Allenby.</p>

<p>This successful campaign in Palestine had several
important results. The capture of Jerusalem after
almost seven centuries of Turkish control led to general
rejoicing among the Allied nations. Large numbers of
Jews throughout the world, who had long looked forward
to the re&euml;stablishment of a Jewish nation in Palestine,
now felt that a long step had been taken toward the
realization of their hopes. From a military point of
view, however, the chief result of the British campaign
in Palestine was that it definitely freed the Suez Canal
from further danger of a Turkish attack.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 127]<a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a></span></p>
<p><b>The Offensive against Italy.</b>&mdash;At the beginning of
1917 the Italian forces were within eleven miles of their
great objective, the city and port of Trieste. During
the late spring and summer the advance continued.
Austrian trenches were occupied and tens of thousands
of Austrian soldiers were captured. After two years
of effort it seemed that the Italians would obtain
the city and incorporate its population&mdash;very largely
Italian&mdash;into the kingdom of Italy. But conditions
in Austria and Germany had greatly changed. The
cessation of war by Russia relieved the Central Powers
of the necessity of keeping large armies on the eastern
front. Further, the campaign had been going against
Germany on the western front, and an easy victory in
Italy might quiet criticism at home.</p>

<p>An immense army of Austrians and Germans was
gathered together to attack the Italian forces. The
Italians were spread out in a semicircle about one
hundred and fifty miles long stretching from near Trent
to within a few miles of Trieste. The Austrians controlled
the upper passes in the mountains, so that they
could attack this long line where they would. Thus the
Italian military position was difficult to defend. The
campaign began with a surprise attack by picked German
troops at a point where the morale of one Italian
division had previously been weakened by the pretended
fraternizing of Austrian troops.</p>

<p>The Austro-German drive (October-December, 1917)
swiftly undid the work of two years of most arduous endeavor.
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 128]<a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a></span>The Italians were forced back from Gorizia and
compelled to surrender mountain positions which had been
captured by them at enormous cost. Back across the
boundary they retreated, losing heavily in men and material.
The enemy advanced into the low country near
Venice, and it seemed for a time that the city would fall
into their hands. But British and French assistance was
sent to Italy, the Italian army recovered its spirit, and
a permanent check was put to the enemy's advance before
Venice was reached. Upon a much shorter but more
defensible line the Italians held the enemy at bay in
the mountains and along the river Piave (pyah&acute;v&#257;).</p>

<span class="caption">WAR ZONES</span>
</div>

<p><b>Unrestricted Submarine Warfare.</b>&mdash;On January 31,
1917, the German ambassador to the United States,
Count von Bernstorff,
announced
to President Wilson
that Germany
would begin unrestricted
submarine
warfare the following
day, in the
waters around
Great Britain and
France,<a name="FNanchor_1_4" id="FNanchor_1_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> thus withdrawing
the pledge
given as a result of
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 129]<a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a></span>the sinking of the "Sussex." Three days later the
President handed Count von Bernstorff his passports
and recalled Ambassador Gerard&acute; from Berlin, thus
severing diplomatic relations with Germany.</p>

<p>During the next six months shipping was sunk at
an average rate of 600,000 tons per month, three times
as fast as before, and two or three times faster than it
was being replaced. The highwater mark was reached
in April, when 800,000 tons of shipping were destroyed.
Unless this loss could be greatly reduced the Allies
for want of food and materials would soon have to give
up fighting.</p>

<p>But methods were quickly devised to combat the
new danger. The patrols were increased, ships voyaged
under convoy of fast destroyers constantly hovering
about on the watch for submarines, and other
protective measures were taken, so that the submarine
menace was soon much reduced. By September, 1918,
the sinkings were only about 150,000 tons a month,
while the production of ships, especially in the United
States, has increased to several times this amount.</p>

<p>Apparently Germany had waited until she had built
a large number of submarines, thinking that by the
use of a great fleet of them in a ruthless warfare on
shipping she could force a peace within a few months.
In this expectation she was disappointed. The principal
result of the withdrawal of her pledge to this country
was the entrance of the United States into the war on
the side of the Allies. Captain Persius, an expert
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 130]<a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a></span>German naval critic, admitted in November, 1917,
that the German admiralty was grossly mistaken in
its calculations and that Germany had no reason for
believing in the decisive influence of the submarine war.</p>

<p><b>The United States Drifts toward War.</b>&mdash;The breaking
off of diplomatic relations is not a declaration of
war. Nevertheless the events immediately succeeding
the withdrawal of Count von Bernstorff made a
declaration of war increasingly probable. The most
important of these were the publication of the Zimmerman
note, the fact that several American merchant
ships were actually sunk by German submarines, and
the discovery that members of the German embassy
and other German diplomatic representatives had been
concerned in plotting on United States soil against
the Allies, thus endangering our peaceful relations with
them. Not only so, but there was evidence that plots
had been laid to destroy American lives and property
in this country and to stir up internal disorders, such
as strikes and riots.</p>

<p><b>The Zimmerman Note.</b>&mdash;On the last day of February,
the Secretary of State published a note that
had come into his possession which was addressed by
Dr. Zimmerman, the German foreign minister, to the
German minister in Mexico. The note stated that
Germany would soon begin a ruthless submarine warfare
and proposed, if the United States should declare
war on Germany, that Mexico should enter into an
alliance with Germany. Germany was to furnish
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 131]<a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a></span>money and Mexico was to reconquer New Mexico,
Texas, and Arizona. It was also hinted that Mexico
should suggest to Japan that the latter country should
come into the agreement. The interesting thing about
the note is that it was dated January 19, twelve
days before Germany announced to us her plan for
ruthless submarine warfare, and during a time when
our relations with Germany, though under a great
strain, were still peaceable.</p>

<p><b>Armed Neutrality.</b>&mdash;About the time the Zimmerman
note was published, President Wilson asked Congress
to authorize the arming of American merchant
ships for their own defense. A small minority in Congress
by their obstructive tactics prevented the passage
of the desired resolution before Congress expired on
March 4. On March 12 the President announced
that this country had determined to place an armed
guard on all United States merchant vessels, which
under international law might defend themselves from
attack, although Germany denied this right. There
is no evidence, however, that there was any encounter
between these armed ships and German vessels prior to
the outbreak of the war.</p>

<p><b>The President's War Message.</b>&mdash;When Russia deposed
the Czar and established a democratic government,
in March, 1917, the last reason was removed
which might have held us back from a declaration of
war. Many believed that it would have been illogical
for us to fight for democracy side by side with one of
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 132]<a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a></span>the greatest of autocracies. President Wilson called
Congress in special session and on April 2 delivered
his famous war message, asking Congress to declare
that a state of war existed between the United States
and Germany.</p>

<p>In the message he told of the various acts of Germany
which had led up to the verge of war, recited the steps
which our government had taken to bring Germany to
realize the inevitable results of her crimes against civilization,
and concluded by asking Congress to declare
war. The President stated that the aims of the United
States in the war are:</p>

<p>1. That the people of every nation may determine
the form of government under which they wish to live.</p>

<p>2. That the small nations may have the right to exist
and be protected against aggression.</p>

<p>3. That the future peace of the world may be guaranteed
through the formation of a league of nations.</p>

<p>4. That the world may be made safe for democracy.</p>

<p><b>The Declaration of War.</b>&mdash;In accordance with the
recommendation of the President, Congress declared
war against Germany on April 6, 1917. War was not
declared at this time against Germany's allies, Austria,
Turkey, and Bulgaria. A few days later, however, at
the instance of Germany, Austria and Turkey broke off
diplomatic relations. On December 7, 1917, the United
States declared war on Austria-Hungary.</p>

<p>Following the declaration of war with Germany,
steps were at once taken to put the country in a position
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 133]<a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a></span>to give effective aid to our associates, and the
President from time to time has requested Congress to
grant authority to do those things that would enable us
to take an active part in the war.</p>

<p><b>Other Countries Enter the War.</b>&mdash;After the United
States entered the war, many other countries, especially
Brazil and some of the Spanish American countries,
either broke off relations with Germany or declared
war against her. Most of these countries had close
commercial relationships with the United States, which
would have been seriously interfered with had they
remained neutral.</p>

<p><b>Spurlos Versenkt.</b>&mdash;The decision of some of the
South American countries to side against Germany
was probably hastened by a typical piece of German
bad faith. Argentina was at peace with Germany.
In spite of that fact, the German minister at Buenos
Aires (the Argentine capital) telegraphed to his government
that if possible Argentine ships should be spared,
but if not, they should be sunk without leaving a trace
("<i>spurlos versenkt</i>)." This would involve the drowning
or murdering of the crews, so that there would be no
inconvenient protest on the part of the Argentine
government. It should be added that at the request
of the German minister, the Swedish minister at Buenos
Aires sent these dispatches in code as if they were his
own private messages. In this way the German minister
was able to have them sent over cable lines controlled
by the Allies.</p>

<h3>THE WAR IN 1918</h3>


<p><b>Failure of German Peace Offensive.</b>&mdash;During the
fall of 1917 Germany had started a great discussion of
the terms of the peace which should close the war. In
general the position taken by German spokesmen was
"peace without annexations and without indemnities,"
as proposed by the Russian Bolsheviki. Such talk
was designed to weaken the war spirit of the Allied
peoples, and perhaps to make the German people believe
that they were fighting a war of self-defense. The
time was ripe for a statement of the war aims of Germany's
opponents. This statement, later approved in
general by Allied statesmen, was made by President
Wilson in his address to Congress on January 8, 1918.
It is discussed in detail in Chapter XIV. It was not satisfactory
to Germany's rulers, for they hoped to secure
better terms in a peace of bargains and compromises.</p>

<p><b>Russia Makes a Separate Peace.</b>&mdash;Only in Russia
was this German peace offensive a success. In the
last chapter we saw how in the latter part of 1917
the Bolsheviki had gained control of the government of
Russia and had arranged an armistice with the Central
Powers. This meant the stopping of all fighting along
the eastern front and the consequent freeing of many
thousands of German soldiers to fight in the west.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 136]<a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a></span></p>
<p>At Brest-Litovsk, a town in Russian Poland which
had been occupied by the troops of the Central Powers,
a meeting of delegates was called to arrange the terms
of peace. The negotiations at this place lasted from
December 23, 1917, to February 10, 1918. The Germans
had determined to keep large portions of Russian
territory. At the conference the German delegates
flatly refused to promise to withdraw their troops from
the occupied parts of Russia after the peace. By
February 10 hope of any settlement that would satisfy
Russia had disappeared and the Bolshevik delegates
left Brest-Litovsk. The war, so far as Russia was
concerned, was at an end, but no treaty of peace had
been signed. The Bolshevik government issued orders
for the complete demobilization of the Russian armies
on all the battle fronts.</p>

<p>Germany, determined to compel Russia to accept her
terms, renewed her military operations on February 18.
The result was that Lenine and Trotzky, the Bolshevik
leaders, were forced to agree to the conditions which
had been laid down by the Central Powers at Brest-Litovsk.
Nevertheless the Germans continued their
advance, with practically no opposition, to within
seventy miles of Petrograd.</p>

<p><b>The Separation of Ukrainia and Finland.</b>&mdash;Ukrainia,
the southwestern corner of Russia, is the home of a
Slavic people&mdash;the Little Russians&mdash;closely akin to
the Russians proper. The people of Finland, in the
extreme northwest, are of a distinctly different race. In
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 137]<a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a></span>both these regions there were set up independent governments
which resisted the rule of the Bolsheviki. With
the aid of German
troops the power
of the Bolsheviki in
the new states was
soon destroyed.
Through the setting
up of these
states, particularly
Ukrainia, Germany
hoped to secure
grain supplies, and
to control large iron
and coal deposits.
Dissatisfaction of
the people with
German control,
however, interfered
seriously with the
realizing of such
hopes.</p>

<span class="caption">TREATY OF BREST-LITOVSK
States and Provinces taken from Russia</span>
</div>

<p><b>The Peace of Brest-Litovsk.</b>&mdash;On March 3 peace
between Russia and the Central Powers was finally
signed at Brest-Litovsk. By the terms of the treaties
Russia was compelled (1) to surrender her western provinces
of Poland, Lithuania, Livonia, Esthonia, and
Courland; (2) to recognize the independence of Ukrainia
and Finland; (3) to cede to Turkey certain important
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 138]<a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a></span>districts south of the Caucasus Mountains;<a name="FNanchor_1_5" id="FNanchor_1_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and (4) to
pay a tremendous indemnity. The falsity of the German
talk of "no annexations and no indemnities" was now
evident. Few more disastrous treaties have ever been
forced upon a vanquished nation. It has been estimated
that the treaties of Brest-Litovsk took from Russia
4 per cent of her total area, 26 per cent of her population,
37 per cent of her food stuffs production, 26 per cent of
her railways, 33 per cent of her manufacturing industries,
75 per cent of her coal, and 73 per cent of her iron.</p>

<p><b>Roumania Makes Peace.</b>&mdash;Roumania, deserted by
Russia, was forced to make peace in the spring of 1918,
by ceding to her enemies the whole of the Dobrudja and
also about 3000 square miles of territory on her western
frontier. The Central Powers, moreover, were given
control of the vast petroleum fields and the rich wheat
lands of the defeated nation.</p>

<p>A little later, however, the Russian province of
Bessarabia decided to unite itself to Roumania, as
most of its people are of the Roumanian race.</p>

<p><b>The Russian Situation in 1918.</b>&mdash;In spite of the
Brest-Litovsk treaties, the Allies continued to regard
Russia as a friendly nation. President Wilson took the
lead in this attitude. It was felt that the Russian people
were sadly in need of assistance, but just how this
should be given was a serious problem.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 139]<a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a></span>The question was complicated by the presence in
Russia of a large army of Czecho-Slovaks (check&acute;o-slovaks&acute;).
These soldiers were natives of the northwestern
Slavic provinces of Austria-Hungary. They had been
part of the Austrian army during the victorious Russian
campaigns in Galicia and had been taken prisoners.
The Czecho-Slovaks had always sympathized with the
Allied countries and had fought for Austria unwillingly.
Many, indeed, had later fought as part of the Russian
army. When Russia left the war they feared that they
might be returned to the hated Austrian government.
To avoid this their leaders sought and obtained from
the Bolshevik government permission to travel eastward
through Russia and Siberia to the Pacific. Here
they planned to take ship and after a voyage three
quarters around the globe take their place in the armies
of the Allies. The long journey began. Then the
Bolsheviki, probably acting under German orders, recalled
the permission they had given. The Czecho-Slovaks
went on nevertheless, determined to proceed
even if they had to fight their way. They were opposed
at different points by Bolshevik troops with the assistance
of organized bodies of German and Austrian
prisoners, but the Czecho-Slovaks were victorious. In
fact, with the aid of anti-Bolshevik Russians they seized
control of most of the Siberian railroad, and of parts of
eastern Russia.</p>

<p><b>Allied Intervention in Russia.</b>&mdash;At last the Allied
nations and the United States decided that it was
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 140]<a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a></span>time to undertake military intervention in Russia.
This was carried out in two places. Bodies of American
and Japanese troops were landed on the east coast
of Siberia to co&ouml;perate with the Czecho-Slovaks. The
latter, thus re&euml;nforced, changed their plans for leaving
Russia and decided to fight for the Allied cause where
they were. They were encouraged by the fact that
they were recognized by the Allies and by the United
States as an independent nation.</p>

<p>Another small Allied army was landed on the north
coast of Russia and marched south against the Bolsheviki.
Large parts of Russia north and east of Moscow
declared themselves free of Bolshevik rule. It was
the hope of the Allies that that rule&mdash;now marked
by pillage, murder, and famine&mdash;would shortly be
overthrown and that a new Russia would rise and take
its place among the democracies of the world.</p>

<p><b>The Western Front.</b>&mdash;Early in 1918, after the failure
of the German peace offensive in the west, rumors
came from Germany of preparations for a great military
drive on the western front. The "iron fist" and the
"shining sword" were to break in the doors of those
who opposed a German-made peace. There were good
reasons for such an attack in the spring of 1918. Germany
had withdrawn many troops from the east, where
they were no longer needed to check the Russians.
Further, although a few American troops had reached
France, it was thought that not many could be sent
over before the fall of 1918, and the full weight of
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 141]<a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a></span>America's force could not be exerted before the summer
of 1919. It was to Germany's interest to crush France
and England before the power of the American nation
was thrown into the struggle against her.</p>

<p><b>Germany's New Plan of Attack.</b>&mdash;The German
military leaders therefore determined to stake everything
upon one grand offensive on the western front
while their own force was numerically superior to
that of the Allies. Their expectation of victory in
what they proudly called the "Kaiser's battle," was
based not only upon the possession of greater numbers,
but also upon the introduction of new methods
of fighting which would overcome the old trench
warfare. The new methods comprised three principal
features.</p>

<p>In the first place, much greater use was made of the
element of surprise. Large masses of men were brought
up near the front by night marches, and in daytime
were hidden from airplane observation by smoke
screens, camouflage of various kinds, and by the shelter
of woodlands. In this way any portion of the
opposing trench line could be subjected to a heavy,
unexpected attack.</p>

<p>Secondly, the advance was prepared for by the use
of big guns in enormous quantities and in new ways.
The number of guns brought into use in this offensive
far exceeded that put into the Verdun offensive of 1916,
which had been looked upon as the extreme of possible
concentration of artillery. The shell fire was now
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 142]<a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a></span>to be directed not only against the trenches, but also
far to the rear of the Allied positions. This would
break up roads, railways, and bridges for many miles
behind the trenches and prevent the sending of reinforcements
up to the front. Vast numbers of large
shells containing poisonous "mustard" gas were collected.
These were to be fired from heavy guns and
made to explode far behind the Allied lines. By this
means suffocation might be spread among the reserves,
among motor drivers, and even among the army mules,
and by deranging the transport service make it impossible
to concentrate troops to withstand the German
advance.</p>

<p>In the third place, "shock" troops composed of selected
men from all divisions of the army, were to advance
after the bombardment, in a series of "waves."
When the first wave had reached the limit of its strength
and endurance, it was to be followed up by a second
mass of fresh troops, and this by a third, and so on
until the Allies' defense was completely broken.</p>

<p>By their excess in numbers and by these newly devised
methods of warfare the German leaders hoped to accomplish
three things: (1) to separate the British army
from the French army; (2) to seize the Channel ports
and interrupt by submarines and big guns the transportation
of men and supplies from England to France;
and (3) to capture Paris and compel the French to withdraw
from the war. Let us now see how and why the
Germans failed to secure any one of these three objectives,
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 143]<a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a></span>and how the Allied forces resumed the offensive
in the summer of 1918.</p>

<p><b>The German Advance.</b>&mdash;Five great drives, conducted
according to the newly devised methods of warfare,
were launched by the Germans between March 21 and
July 15, 1918. The first, continuing from March 21 to
April 1, called the battle of Picardy, was directed at the
point where the British army joined that of the French
near the Somme River. There was at this time no unified
command of all the Allied armies, and the blow fell
unexpectedly upon the British and won much territory
before French assistance could be brought up. Outnumbered
three to one, the British fell back at the point
of greatest retreat to a distance of thirty miles from their
former line. But the extreme tenacity of the British
and the arrival of French troops prevented the Germans
from capturing the important city of Amiens (ah-my&#259;n&acute;),
or reaching the main roads to Paris, or separating the
British and French armies. Learning a needed lesson
from this disaster, the Allied nations agreed to a unified
military command, and appointed as commander-in-chief
the French General Foch (fosh), who had distinguished
himself in the first battle of the Marne in 1914 and elsewhere.
Before this step had been taken General Pershing
had offered his small army of 200,000 Americans to be
used wherever needed by the French and the British.</p>

<p>The second German offensive began on April 9 and
was again directed against the British, this time farther
to the north, in Flanders, between the cities of Ypres
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 144]<a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a></span>and Arras. In ten days the Germans advanced to a
maximum depth of ten miles on a front of thirty miles.
But the British fought most desperately and the German
losses were enormous. At last the advance was
checked and the Channel ports were saved. "Germany
on the march had encountered England at bay"&mdash;and
had failed to destroy the heroic British army.</p>

<p>And now came a lull of over a month while the Germans
were reorganizing their forces and preparing for a still
greater blow. Again the element of surprise was employed.
The Allies expected another attack somewhere
in the line from Soissons to the sea, and their reserves
were so disposed as to meet such an attack. But the
German blow was directed against the weakest part of
the Allied line, the stretch from Rheims to Soissons, where
a break might open the road to Paris from the east.
The third drive began on May 27. For over a week the
French were pushed back, fighting valiantly, across land
which had not seen the enemy since September, 1914.
The greatest depth of the German advance was thirty
miles, that is, to within forty-four miles of Paris. The
enemy had once again reached the Marne River and
controlled the main roads from Paris to Verdun and to
the eastern parts of the Allied line.</p>

<p>The fourth drive started a few days later, on June 9,
in a region where an attack was expected. It resulted
in heavy losses to the Germans, who succeeded in pushing
only six miles toward Paris in the region between
Soissons and Montdidier (mawn-dee-dy&#257;&acute;). The advantages
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 145]<a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a></span>of a single command had begun to appear.
General Foch could use all the Allied forces where they
were most needed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a href="images/145.png"><img src="images/thumb_145.png" width="500" height="446" alt="WESTERN FRONT" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">WESTERN FRONT</span>
</div>

<p>The fifth drive opened on July 15 and spread over
a front of one hundred miles east of Soissons. The
Allies were fully prepared, and while falling back a little
at first, the American and French troops soon won back
some of the abandoned territory.</p>

<p><b>The Turning of the Tide.</b>&mdash;A glance at a map of the
battle front of July 18 will show that the Germans had
driven three blunt wedges into the Allied lines. These
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 146]<a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a></span>positions would prove dangerous to the Germans if ever
the Allies were strong enough to assume the offensive.
And just now the moment came for Foch to strike a
great counter-blow. During the spring and early summer
American troops had been speeded across the
Atlantic until by the Fourth of July over a million men
were in France. On July 18 fresh American and French
troops attacked the Germans in the narrowest of the
wedges along the Marne River and within a few days
compelled the enemy to retreat from this wedge. On
August 8 a British army began a surprise attack on the
middle wedge, and by the use of large numbers of light,
swift tanks succeeded in driving the Germans back for
a distance of over ten miles on a wide front.</p>

<p>The offensive had now passed from the Germans to
the Allies. Under Foch's repeated attacks the enemy
was driven back first at one point and then at another.
He had no time to prepare a counter-drive; he did not
know where the next blow would fall. By the end of
September he had given up nearly all his recent conquests, devastating much of the country as he retired.
In several places also he was forced still farther back,
across the old Hindenburg line. In two days (September
12-13) the Americans and French under the direction
of General Pershing wiped out an old German salient
near Metz, taking 200 square miles of territory and
15,000 prisoners. Altogether, by the end of September,
Foch had taken over a quarter of a million prisoners,
with 3,669 cannon and 23,000 machine guns.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 147]<a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a></span>It is said that the complete defeat of the German
plans was due primarily to three things: "(1) the dogged
steadfastness of the British and the patient heroism of
the French soldiers and civilians; (2) the brilliant strategy
of General Foch, and the unity of command which
made this effective; (3) the material and moral encouragement
of the American forces, of whom nearly 1,500,000
were in France before the end of August."</p>

<p><b>The War in Italy, the Balkans, and Syria.</b>&mdash;The
summer of 1918 witnessed the launching of a great
offensive by the Austrians against the Italian armies
holding the Piave front. It is probable that the chief
purpose of this blow was to draw Allied troops into
Italy from the battle front in Belgium and France.
The Italians, however, proved themselves amply able
to fight their own battle, and the Austrian attempt was
repulsed with tremendous losses.</p>

<p>The autumn of this year saw important happenings
on the Balkan front also. This theater of the war had
been uneventful for a long time. The battle line extended
from the Adriatic Sea to the &AElig;gean, and was
held by a mixed army of Serbians, Greeks, Italians,
British, and French, under the command of General
D'Esperey (des-pr&#257;&acute;), with headquarters at Salonica.
Opposed to these troops were armies of Bulgarians
and Austrians, together with a considerable number of
Germans. Encouraged by the German defeats in the
west, which had forced the withdrawal of large numbers
of German troops from eastern Europe, the Allies
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 148]<a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a></span>launched a strong offensive on the Balkan front in the
middle of September. Day after day their advance
continued, resulting in the capture of many thousands
of prisoners and the reoccupation of many miles of Albanian
and Serbian territory. The campaign was one of
the most successful of the whole war. Within two weeks
the Bulgarians asked for an armistice, accepted the terms
that were demanded, and on September 30 definitely
withdrew from the war. Their surrender broke the lines
of communication between the Central Powers and
Turkey and at one blow destroyed Teutonic supremacy
in the Balkans. An even more important consequence
was the moral effect on the general public in Germany,
Austria, and Turkey, where it was taken by many as a
sign that surrender of the Central Powers could only
be a question of time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, events of almost equal importance were
taking place in Palestine and Syria. General Allenby
had taken Jerusalem in December, 1917. In the fall
of 1918 new and important advances were made in this
region, Arab forces east of the Jordan co&ouml;perating with
the British armies. By the close of September more
than 50,000 Turkish soldiers and hundreds of guns had
been captured. In October General Allenby's men
took the important cities of Damascus and Aleppo,
and in Mesopotamia also the British began a new advance.
Turkey was already asking for an armistice,
and now accepted terms that were virtually a complete
surrender (October 31).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 149]<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a></span>By this time Austria-Hungary was in the throes of
dissolution; independent republics were being set up by
the Czechs, the Hungarians, the Jugo-Slavs, and even
the German Austrians. These revolutions were hastened
by the overwhelming victory of the Italians in
the second battle of the Piave. Their attack began
October 24 on the mountain front, but soon the Allied
forces under General Diaz (dee&acute;ahss) crossed the river
and cut through the lines of the fleeing Austrians. In
the capture of large numbers of prisoners and guns the
Italians took full vengeance for their defeat of the preceding
year. So hopeless, indeed, was the situation
for the Austrians that they too accepted an armistice
that was practically a surrender (November 4).</p>

<p><b>German Retreat in the West.</b>&mdash;After the Germans
had been driven back to their old lines in France, there
was danger that the contest might settle down to the
old form of trench warfare. But the intricate defenses
of the Hindenburg line, in some cases extending to a
depth of ten miles from the front trenches, did not
prove strong enough to withstand the American and
Allied advance. Foch attacked the line from each end
and also in the center. In the north, by October 20,
Belgian and British troops had recaptured all the
Belgian coast, with its submarine bases; and the
British had taken the important cities of Lens and
Lille, the former valuable on account of its coal mines.
In the center British and French troops broke through
to the important points of Cambrai, St. Quentin
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 150]<a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a></span>(s&#259;n-kahn-t&#259;n&acute;) and Laon (lahn), while farther east the
French and Americans began an advance along the
Meuse River, threatening to attack the German line in
the rear.</p>

<p>By this time it seemed likely that a general retirement
from Belgium and France had been determined
upon by the German leaders. Moreover, the impending
defeat of the German armies led to a new peace
drive by the German government. On October 6
President Wilson received a note from the German
Chancellor asking for an armistice, requesting that
the United States take steps for the restoration of
peace, and stating that the German government accepted
as a basis for peace negotiations the program as
laid down in the President's message to Congress of
January 8, 1918 (Chapter XIV), and in his subsequent
addresses. In the ensuing correspondence several points
are worthy of special notice. President Wilson opposed
any suggestion of an armistice till after the evacuation
of Allied territory, or except as it might be arranged by
the military advisers of the American and Allied powers,
on such terms as would make impossible the renewal
of hostilities by Germany. He also called attention to
the following point in his address of July 4, 1918,&mdash;"The
destruction of every arbitrary power anywhere
that can separately, secretly, and of its single choice
disturb the peace of the world, or, if it cannot be presently
destroyed, at the least its reduction to virtual
impotence";&mdash;stated that the military autocracy still
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 151]<a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a></span>in control of Germany was such a power; and insisted
on dealing only with a new or altered German government
in which the representatives of the people should
be the real rulers.</p>

<p>On November 11, while the German armies in France
and Belgium were being defeated by the Allied and
American forces, envoys from the German government
accepted from General Foch an armistice in terms that
meant virtually the surrender of Germany, and thus
brought hostilities to an end.</p>

<h3>THE UNITED STATES IN THE WAR</h3>


<p><b>Part of the Navy Sent to Europe.</b>&mdash;One of the first
things done after our entrance into the war was to send
a considerable part of our navy to Europe, not only
battleships to augment the fleet that was holding the
German navy in check, but also a number of swift
torpedo boats and destroyers to aid in reducing the
menace from submarines. Huge appropriations were
made by Congress for the purpose of increasing the
number of lighter craft in the navy. Particularly efficient
submarine chasers were developed, called "Eagles,"
which, by being made all alike, could be quickly produced
in great numbers.</p>

<p><b>Raising the Army.</b>&mdash;Great numbers of young men
at once enlisted in various branches of the service.
Profiting, however, by the experience of Great Britain,
the government determined on conscription as a more
democratic method of raising an army. A draft law
was passed providing for the enrollment of all men
between the ages of twenty-one and thirty-one. These
were examined and classified, and from time to time
large groups were sent to camps to be trained. Each
of these camps can take care of approximately fifty
thousand soldiers. Under a later draft law passed in
1918, the age limits for enrolling men were extended to
include those from eighteen to forty-five.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 153]<a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a></span><b>Officers' Training Camps.</b>&mdash;In order to provide officers
for such an emergency as now confronted the nation,
training camps for officers had been established the
previous year at several places in the country. These
officers were now called upon to aid the regular army
officers in training the recruits. The officers' training
camps have been continued and increased in number
in order that a regular supply of properly trained
officers may be available for the constantly increasing
army.</p>

<p><b>Supplies and Munitions.</b>&mdash;The industries of the
country were compelled to turn their attention to the
making of supplies and munitions for our fighters. The
great plants that had been making powder, guns, shells,
and other munitions for the Allies started to make these
things for the United States. This was easy to arrange,
since England and France had about reached a position
where they were able to supply themselves. Besides,
great quantities of food and clothing were also needed,
and the meat packers and the manufacturers of textiles,
shoes, and other articles turned their plants to the production
of supplies for the army.</p>

<p><b>Aircraft.</b>&mdash;The war in Europe had shown the high
usefulness of aircraft as part of the military forces.
Recognizing this, Congress appropriated two thirds of
a billion dollars for the purpose of constructing thousands
of airplanes and for training thousands of pilots
and other experts to use them. Unfortunately much
time was lost in building manufacturing plants and in
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 154]<a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a></span>experimenting with various types of engines and other
parts of airplanes. Only a small part of the twenty
thousand it had been planned to send to France by
June, 1918, were completed at that time. Meanwhile,
however, engineers had developed, on the basis of the
automobile engine, an improved engine known as the
Liberty Motor, and the production of efficient airplanes
was at last going ahead rapidly.</p>

<p><i>Food and Fuel Control.</i>&mdash;So large a proportion of
the population of the European countries is employed
in carrying on the war that there has been a constant
decrease in the amount of food produced in Europe.
Fortunately, up to 1917 this country had enough for
itself and sufficient to spare for the Allies and the neutral
nations. In 1917 there was an unusually short
cereal crop all over the world. The result was that
there was not enough food to go round, if every one in
this country ate as much as usual.</p>

<p>In order that proper conservation of food might be
brought about, a food commission was created, not only
to prevent profiteering, but also to direct how the people
should economize in order to help win the war. Shortages
in various kinds of food were controlled at first
through voluntary rationing under requests made by the
Food Administrator. Later on, limits were placed on
the amount of wheat, flour, and sugar that could be
bought by large dealers and bakeries. A certain proportion
of other cereals had to be purchased with each
purchase of wheat. Bakers were required to make
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 155]<a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a></span>their bread with a proportion of other flours mixed with
the wheat. These regulations were enforced by such
punishments as fines, the closing of stores or bakeries,
or by depriving the offender of his supply for a given
length of time. Kitchens were established in large
communities where housewives could learn the best
ways of making bread with the use of various substitutes
for wheat.</p>

<p>Early in the fall of 1917 it was seen that, because of
inadequate transportation facilities and of a tremendously
increasing demand for coal by the war industries,
there would be a shortage of fuel during the winter.
Accordingly a Fuel Administrator was appointed who
regulated the distribution of fuel. Industries essential
to the war were supplied, while those that were not doing
needful work had their supply reduced or cut off altogether.
As it happened, the winter of 1917-1918 was
exceedingly severe, freight congestion became worse
and worse, and the shortage in the industrial centers
was even greater than had been anticipated. The
control of fuel saved the people of the northeastern
section of our country from much distress, and assured a
supply of fuel for war purposes.</p>

<p>Later in 1918 householders and mercantile establishments
were allowed only a portion of their usual coal
supply, the number of stops made by street railway
cars was reduced, and window and other display lighting
was forbidden on all but two nights in the week.
An act of Congress directed that from the last Sunday
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 156]<a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a></span>in March till the last Sunday in October all clocks must
be set one hour ahead of time. This regulation brings
more of our activities into the daylight hours and so
cuts down the use of artificial light. By these methods
much coal was conserved for the use of factories engaged
in war work.</p>

<p><b>Transportation Control.</b>&mdash;Soon after war was declared,
the railroads of the country put themselves at
the disposal of the government in order to take care of
the increase in transportation service required by the
state of war. The nearly seven hundred railroads of
the country were organized and run as a single system
under the direction of a Railroads' War Board, composed
of some of the chief railroad officials.</p>

<p>Passenger train service was reduced, chiefly in order
to provide for the transportation of several million
soldiers to and from training camps. Freight cars and
locomotives from one railroad were kept as long as
they were needed in the service of another. The roads
no longer competed with each other for freight, but
goods were sent over the road that had, at the time of
shipment, the most room for additional traffic. At the
end of 1917, as a measure of economy and to secure even
greater unity of organization, the government took
over the control of the railroads for the period of the
war. As Director General of Railroads, the President
appointed William G. McAdoo, who was also the Secretary
of the Treasury.</p>

<p>Half a year later, the government likewise took over,
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 157]<a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a></span>for the duration of the war, the operation of telegraph
and telephone lines, which were placed under the control
of the Postmaster-General.</p>

<p><b>Shipbuilding.</b>&mdash;Less than two weeks after the declaration
of war the United States Shipping Board Emergency
Fleet Corporation was organized with a capital
of fifty million dollars all owned by the government.
The Shipping Board had been formed some time before
to increase the merchant shipping of the country.
When war came, more and yet more ships were needed,
not only to take our armies, and their food and fighting
material, to Europe, but also to replace the shipping
destroyed by submarines. In order that these ships
might be built as speedily as possible it was desirable
that the government should direct the work. Existing
shipyards were taken over, and new shipyards were
built by the government. In the building of ships the
original program was more than doubled, and the United
States became the greatest shipbuilding nation of the
world. This was made possible largely through the
construction of what are known as "fabricated ships";
that is, many ships built exactly alike, from parts made
in quantities. Patterns are made for each special piece
of steel and sent to steel plants in different parts of the
country. There dozens of pieces are made exactly like
the pattern. All the pieces for a ship are sent to the
shipyard ready to be riveted in their proper places.
Thus the shipyard can work much faster than if the
pieces were prepared at the yard.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 158]<a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a></span><b>German Shipping Seized.</b>&mdash;Immediately upon the
declaration of war, the President ordered the seizure of
ninety-nine German merchant ships which were in our
ports. Most of them had been in harbor since August,
1914. They had been free to sail if they wished, but
preferred not to risk capture by British or French
warships.</p>

<p>When the United States officials took charge of these
vessels, it was found that important parts of their
machinery had been destroyed or broken, under orders
from Germany. Repairs were quickly and skillfully
made, the German names of the ships were changed,
and a few months later over six hundred thousand tons
of German-built ships were taking American troops and
supplies across the seas.</p>

<p><b>Paying for the War.</b>&mdash;Wars nowadays cost enormous
sums of money, on account of the highly technical
material that is used as well as the great size of the
armies. There are two ways by which the money can
be raised. The government can borrow money, and it
can raise money by taxation. It was found wise to pay
for the war by depending on both of these methods.</p>

<p>In May and June our people were called upon to subscribe
to an issue of two billion dollars' worth of Liberty
bonds. Half as much more was offered to the government.
A second loan for three billions in November
was again oversubscribed by fifty per cent. In 1918 the
third loan for three billion, and the fourth loan, for six
billion, were also oversubscribed. Up to November,
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 159]<a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a></span>1918, the government asked for fourteen billion dollars,
the people offered to lend about eighteen billion dollars,
and the government accepted about sixteen billion
dollars.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, the Treasury department
authorized the sale of two billion dollars' worth of War
Savings Stamps during the year 1918. These stamps
represent short-time loans to the government which
are so small that practically every person is able to
invest in them.</p>

<p>It was deemed important also that the people should
pay a large percentage of the war bill through taxes.
Congress therefore passed a tax bill which not only
increased the income taxes to be paid by individuals
and companies, but also placed heavy taxes on many
things which were more or less in the nature of luxuries,
or at least were not essential to life. Railroad tickets,
admission tickets to amusements of all sorts, telephone
and telegraph messages, and hundreds of other things
above a certain low minimum cost were taxed. In
this way the government raised six or seven billion
dollars in a single year, approximately one third of the
current cost of the war.</p>

<p><b>Loans to the Allies.</b>&mdash;Our government has from time
to time advanced much money to the other nations
who are fighting Germany. Practically all of these
loans are in the form of credits with which the Allies
pay for materials bought in the United States. Little
if any of the money so loaned goes out of the country.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 160]<a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a></span><b>Red Cross and Other Organizations.</b>&mdash;The American
Red Cross Society, formed for the relief of suffering
through war or other disaster, was made ready for
extensive work by the subscription of one hundred and
fifty million dollars in June, 1917, by the people of the
country. The work was organized on a national basis
and in every community there was formed a Red Cross
Chapter to make garments, sweaters, or woolen head
coverings to keep the soldiers warm; to roll bandages;
to open canteens or refreshment stations for soldiers
while traveling or in camp; to train nurses to care
for the sick and wounded, and to do other work of a
similar sort.</p>

<p>Other organizations such as the Young Men's Christian
Association and the Knights of Columbus took
upon themselves the task of entertaining and making
comfortable our soldiers and sailors, providing places
where they may read, write letters, play games, and
otherwise relieve their minds from the terrible strain
of war.</p>

<p>If our army and navy that are fighting for us in
Europe represent the strength of our country, we can
also say that the work of the Red Cross and these other
organizations represents the heart of our country.</p>

<p><b>The Work of Schools in the War.</b>&mdash;School pupils
are the largest and best-organized group of the population
of the country. It was natural, therefore, for
the government to turn to the school children when it
wanted a national response. Boys and girls having the
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 161]<a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a></span>lessons of the war impressed upon them in school, carry
the message home. Often in no other way can the
parents be reached.</p>

<p>There are many ways in which the school children
gave direct and valuable help to the nation. It is not
possible to do more than merely hint at some of these.</p>

<p>The importance of saving and thrift was early impressed
on the children, not only through the thrift
stamp and Liberty loan campaigns, but also through
direct lessons on conserving food, clothing, and public
and private property.</p>

<p>Many children planted and took care of war gardens,
adding a total of many million dollars' worth of food
to the nation's supply. In connection with the gardens,
a canning campaign was conducted which aimed at the
conservation of perishable food that could not be consumed
at once.</p>

<p>The schools rendered valuable service in doing Red
Cross work. Both boys and girls knit garments and
comforts for our soldiers, and the girls made garments
for the little children of France and Belgium who had
been driven from their homes by the war.</p>

<p><b>Rise in Prices.</b>&mdash;When a country is at war the government
must have what it needs, quickly and at any
price. The price situation is made worse if for any
reason there happens to be a scarcity of a given article.
When the government wants a great quantity of ammunition
for which it is willing to pay a high price, the
manufacturer, desiring to obtain an increased number
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 162]<a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a></span>of workmen quickly, offers unusually high pay. This
attracts workmen from other industries, and the latter
offer still higher pay to retain their workmen. In this
way, wages rapidly go up and things that have to be
produced with labor, like coal, or houses, or ships, rise
enormously in cost. The farmer, too, has to pay more
for his help. In order to induce the farmers to plant
more wheat, the government fixed a high price for it.
This helped to make flour expensive. Many fishermen
went into the navy, or into factories where they
could get high wages. If they kept on fishing, they
thought they ought to make as much money as the
men who had given up fishing and gone to make guns
and build ships.</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest reason for high prices is the actual
scarcity of many things. Many of the men who do
the work of producing are at war. They are using
food and clothing much faster than if they were not
soldiers. A soldier needs about twice as much food,
and wears out eight times as many pairs of shoes,
as he did when he was at home. From these facts
it is easy to see why prices are high during the war.</p>

<p><b>Our Achievements in 1917.</b>&mdash;- As a result of our
unwillingness, before 1917, to face the fact that we
might sometime be involved in war, the tremendous
amount of preparation described in this chapter had
to be done in a few months, or even in a few weeks.
When things have to be done in such a great hurry,
missteps are often made and unfortunate delays result.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 163]<a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a></span>In spite of all difficulties, however, the United States
had, at the end of 1917, two hundred and fifty thousand
troops in France and a million and a half in training
camps. Guns, rifles, clothing, shoes, food, and other
necessary supplies were being produced in sufficient
quantities. On the other side of the Atlantic, our
engineers and railroad men were busy constructing
docks, warehouses, and miles of railroad for the purpose
of providing bases of supplies for our soldiers in France.
Much of the equipment of these railroads and docks
cars, locomotives, and unloading machinery&mdash;had been
brought from America.</p>

<p><b>More Soldiers Sent to France.</b>&mdash;As the troops in the
various camps and cantonments were trained they were
sent to ports on the eastern coast and embarked for
France, their places in camp being taken by new groups
of drafted men. Beginning with fifty or sixty thousand
each month, the number sent abroad was rapidly increased
until by the fall of 1918 the troops were going
over at the rate of more than three hundred thousand
a month. By October 15 there were over two million
of our soldiers in France and another million and more
under training in this country.</p>

<p><b>Decrease in Submarine Sinkings.</b>&mdash;The Germans
had boasted in vain that their submarines would prevent
the transportation of American troops to Europe.
Of the hundreds of transports engaged in this work, up
to November, 1918, only two were sunk while on the
eastward voyage, and less than 300 American soldiers
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 164]<a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a></span>were drowned. Moreover, during the year 1918 there
was a notable decrease in the destruction of merchant
vessels by submarines. This was due probably to a
variety of causes, but especially to the increased protection
provided by the convoy system, and to the more
efficient methods of fighting the submarines.</p>

<p>It has been found that it is possible to see a submarine
at some distance below the surface if the observer is in
a balloon or an airplane. Therefore the submarine
hunters do not need to wait for the submarine to show
itself. The sea is patrolled by balloons and airplanes
in conjunction with fast destroyers. When the aircraft
has located a submarine, the fact is signaled to a
destroyer. When the destroyer arrives over the submarine,
it drops a depth bomb, which is arranged to
explode after it has sunk to any desired depth in the
water.</p>

<p>It is believed that the submarines are being destroyed
faster than Germany can build them, and also that it is
increasingly difficult for Germany to obtain the highly
trained crews necessary to manage the complex machinery
of a submarine. For it must be remembered
that the circumstances under which submarines are
destroyed almost always involve the loss of the crew.</p>

<p><b>Submarines Raid the Atlantic Coast.</b>&mdash;Unable to
face the convoys of transports, several submarines paid
visits to our coast in the summer of 1918. and destroyed
a considerable number of unarmed vessels, mostly
small craft. Many of the victims, indeed, were very
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 165]<a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a></span>small fishing boats, which are, by international agreement,
exempt from capture or destruction.</p>

<p><b>German Propaganda.</b>&mdash;Before the United States
entered the war, our people were divided in their sympathies
between the Central Powers and the Allies.
Those who believed that Germany was right were
chiefly people of German birth or descent, though a
large majority even of this group did not believe in
the things for which Germany was fighting.</p>

<p>Since the United States was neutral, their attitude was
perfectly legal, provided their sympathies did not lead
them to commit crimes against the United States in
their zeal to hinder the cause of the Allies. Unfortunately,
ever since we entered the war some of these
people, still keeping on the side of Germany, have endeavored
in every way to prevent the success of the
American cause. Some of these men and women are
American-born, others have, through naturalization,
sworn to uphold the government of the United States,
but still others have remained subjects of the Central
Powers. They have organized plots either to destroy
property, or to spread rumors intended to interfere with
the prosecution of the war and to undermine confidence
in the government.</p>

<p>Munition factories have been blown up, and information
has been secretly sent to German authorities concerning
the movements of ships so that they could be
attacked by submarines. Worse than all else, perhaps,
is the circulation of groundless rumors such as
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 166]<a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a></span>those stating that the soldiers have insufficient food
or clothing, or insinuating that officers of the government
are guilty of outrageous offenses in their treatment
of men and women who have entered war service.</p>

<p><b>The Citizen and the Propagandist.</b>&mdash;It is the duty
of every true citizen, boy or girl, man or woman, to do
two things to stop this treason talk. First, when
some one tells you a thing about our government that
ought not to be true, and sounds as if the speaker was
trying to undermine the efforts of our country to win
the war, ask him, "How do you know?" and then report
the matter to the first policeman or other trustworthy
person that you meet. The second thing you should
do is carefully to avoid spreading any such rumors that
you may hear.</p>

<p><b>How the Government Controls Propaganda.</b>&mdash;Our
country has sought to control the treasonable work of
these propagandists in three ways.</p>

<p>First, all who are subjects of any enemy country, and
who are above fourteen years of age, must be enrolled,
and must carry a certificate with them wherever they
go. They may not live within a half mile of navy
yards, arsenals, or other places where war work is
going on, and they may not go within three hundred
feet of any wharf or dock.</p>

<p>Secondly, those whose conduct has been suspicious,
or who have displayed active sympathy with the enemy
in speech or act, as well as certain persons who were in
official relationship with Germany, are interned for the
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 167]<a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a></span>duration of the war. Internment means that they are
under close guard in a camp, or in a small district, but
otherwise have considerable freedom.</p>

<p>In the third place, German sympathizers who have
committed or have attempted to commit crimes endangering
the lives of our citizens, or interfering in anyway
with the conduct of the war, have been sent to
prison for long terms.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Suggestions for Study.</b>&mdash;1. Define cantonment; camp; barracks;
army post. Describe the insignia of different grades of
officers in the army and in the navy. Find some fact about
General Pershing; about Admiral Sims. What is meant by
propaganda? What is an alien enemy? 2. On a map of the
United States mark the chief camps and cantonments. Locate
the chief shipbuilding centers. 3. Make a collection of Food
Saving notices and of literature and posters about Liberty Loans
and War Savings Stamps. Make copies with names and dates
of interesting letters from the front. 4. Collect pictures of shipbuilding
and of transporting food to Europe. 5. Why did the
navy go first to Europe? 6. How does the draft put a man into
the army? 7. What factories near your home have done war
work? 8. In what ways can a boy or girl save food? 9. Name
five things on which you have to pay a war tax. 10. What can
a boy or girl do for the Junior Red Cross? 11. Why do clothes
and shoes cost more than before the war? 12. Why are some
alien enemies put into prison or into detention camps?</p>

<h3>QUESTIONS OF THE COMING PEACE</h3>


<p>There are two kinds of problems which must be
solved by the American people before permanent peace
conditions can be established. One group of problems
is composed of international questions, largely
pertaining to the European states, but in which the
United States is vitally interested. The other group
of problems relates to the restoration of our people and
industries to a peace condition. On some points these
two groups of problems are closely related and cannot
be settled separately. Some internal questions will
have to be viewed in the light of world affairs; and some
international problems must be given solutions which
will have influences within our own country. Ignoring
the overlapping of the two groups, we shall study
the problems of peace in this chapter under two headings:
(1) national problems; (2) international problems.</p>


<h4>I. <span class="smcap">National Problems</span></h4>

<p>Among the many internal problems which the country
will face at the close of the war, and to which every
American should to-day be giving his earnest thought,
the following are specially important.</p>

<p><b>Getting the Men Home.</b>&mdash;Even while engaged in
the task of getting every available man to the fighting
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 169]<a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a></span>line in Europe, the American authorities have found
time to think of the return movement. It will be a
great undertaking, requiring many months, to see that
each man reaches American shores and after his dismissal
is safely sent to his home town.</p>

<p><b>The Care of the Wounded.</b>&mdash;During the war the
greatest pains have been taken by the medical officers
of the army, and by the Red Cross agents, to bring
immediate relief to the brave wounded men, and to
nurse them back to health. But many of them will
have sacrificed an eye or a limb, or will have received
wounds which will prevent their engaging in their
previous occupations. It is the high duty of the nation
to save such men from a life of pain or of enforced idleness.
It should not permit them to subsist by charity,
or even pensions. The wounded man, crippled for life
in his nation's service, will be educated in a vocation
which will occupy his mind, make him independent,
and render him a respected and self-respecting member
of his community. This great educational work has
already been started, courses of study have been put
into operation, and positions in various industrial
plants have been guaranteed to the men after the
training is completed. The nation will perform its
whole duty to its heroes.</p>

<p><b>The Reconstruction of Industry.</b>&mdash;The war has
called into existence great plants for the manufacture
of the specialties needed in warfare. Such factories
must, after the close of the war, be made over and set
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 170]<a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a></span>to the task of creating goods for the days of peace.
Machinery will be reconstructed, agencies for the sale
of goods must be established, and foreign trade sought
as a possible market for the enlarged production.</p>

<p><b>The Reorganization of Labor.</b>&mdash;American working
people, whether they be managers of plants or workmen
at the machine, have been wonderfully loyal to the
nation during the war. They have shifted their work,
their homes, and their aspirations to meet the needs of
the war. When peace returns all this talent and skill
must be turned into other channels. This we hope
can be accomplished without unemployment on a large
scale, and without any loss of time or pay. But it will
require great directing ability, and a friendly attitude of
employees and employers toward each other.</p>

<p><b>Financial Reconstruction.</b>&mdash;The finances of the government,
of corporations, and of business men have
been greatly changed during the course of the war.
There may never be a complete return to the old conditions.
But it is certain that peace will create problems
of finance almost as serious as those of war.</p>

<p><b>Legislative Changes.</b>&mdash;Our legislative bodies, particularly
the Congress, will be called upon to pass many
laws to aid the country to resume its peaceful life and
occupations. All of the problems mentioned here, as
well as many others, will require the enactment of new
laws. We shall need congressmen and state legislators
of wisdom, patriotism, and special knowledge to act
intelligently for the people on these problems. The
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 171]<a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a></span>international settlements mentioned below also may
require the action of the Senate upon treaties, and the
action of both houses where laws are necessary to carry
out our international agreements. The war has called
for statesmanship of the highest order; the coming
peace will make equal demands upon the wisdom and
self-control of our statesmen and politicians.</p>


<h4>II. <span class="smcap">International Problems</span></h4>

<p>President Wilson, on January 8, 1918, addressed
Congress in a speech which was designed to set forth
the war aims and peace terms of the United States.
Every American should be familiar with the terms
of this "fourteen-point speech." Each one of the
terms advocated by the President is given below in
the President's own words, and a short explanatory
paragraph is added to each.</p>

<p>1. <i>Open covenants of peace, openly arrived at, after
which there shall be no private international understandings
of any kind, but diplomacy shall proceed always
frankly and in the public view.</i></p>

<p>The President here speaks against the underhand
diplomacy and secret alliances which have been a
feature of European history in the past. By this practice
a few diplomats and monarchs made whatever
treaties they wished, not presenting them for ratification
to the people's representatives, and yet binding
every individual citizen to abide by the terms adopted.
Such secret provisions have often been agreed to simply
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 172]<a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a></span>upon the whim or the ambition or the likes and dislikes
of the rulers. They have sometimes been opposed to
the true interests of the nations involved. They are
undemocratic, and are not in accord with American
ideas.</p>

<p>2. <i>Absolute freedom of navigation upon the seas, outside
territorial waters, alike in peace and in war, except
as the seas may be closed in whole or in part by international
action for the enforcement of international covenants.</i></p>

<p>Since 1793 the United States has stood for the freedom
of the seas and the right of neutrals to carry on
their trade in time of war as well as in time of peace.
Germany's violation of our rights as a neutral by her
submarine warfare was one of the causes of our taking
up arms against her. By territorial waters the President
here means the waters within three miles from
shore, which are universally held to be under the complete
control of the adjoining state. By international
covenants are probably meant such covenants and
guarantees as those mentioned in points 14, 1, 4, 11,
12, and 13.</p>

<p>3. <i>The removal, so far as possible, of all economic barriers
and the establishment of an equality of trade conditions
among all the nations consenting to the peace and
associating themselves for its maintenance.</i></p>

<p>Economic barriers are mainly restrictions upon
trade and commerce. These restrictions take various
forms; they may be prohibitive customs duties, or
excessive port, tonnage, and harbor charges; they may
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 173]<a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a></span>be trade agreements granting favors to the citizens of
one country and <i>not</i> to those of another. The President
urges the establishment of an equality of such
trade conditions.</p>

<p>4. <i>Adequate guarantees given and taken that national
armaments will be reduced to the lowest point consistent
with domestic safety.</i></p>

<p>The President here touches one of the most important
problems of the coming peace. This has often been
called a war against war; it has been said that it will
be the last war. The sentiment which leads to such
statements has its origin in a hatred of militarism.
Great armaments were created because of the danger
from Prussian militarism; and great armaments will
still be necessary unless "this intolerable thing" is
crushed or "shut out from the friendly intercourse of
the nations." When it is crushed, some adequate
steps must be taken by each state to reduce its armaments,
on condition that all other states do the same.
But many problems will face the world's statesmen in
preparing a plan for guaranteed disarmament. How
large a force will each nation need to maintain its "domestic
safety"? How shall we be sure that Germany
will not break her promise, as she has so often done in
this war? How shall we be sure that Germany, or
perhaps some other state, will not again secretly prepare
for a war while others remain unprepared?</p>

<p>5. <i>A free, open-minded, and absolutely impartial
adjustment of all colonial claims, based upon a strict
</i><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 174]<a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a></span><i>observance of the principle that in determining all such
questions of sovereignty the interests of the populations
concerned must have equal weight with the equitable claims
of the government whose title is to be determined.</i></p>

<p>In the opening chapters of this book we have seen
how colonial rivalry was one of the causes of the World
War. The President urges that the settlement after
the war shall be "free, open-minded, and absolutely
impartial." He introduces here the democratic principle
that the interests of the populations in the colonies
shall have equal weight with the just claims of the
European states. Such a principle probably will mean
that few if any of Germany's colonies can be returned
to her, because her colonial management has been
neglectful of the interests of the subject peoples.</p>

<p>6. <i>The evacuation of all Russian territory and such a
settlement of all questions affecting Russia as will secure
the best and freest co&ouml;peration of the other nations of the
world in obtaining for her an unhampered and unembarrassed
opportunity for the independent determination
of her own political development and national policy and
assure her of a sincere welcome into the society of free
nations under institutions of her own choosing, and, more
than a welcome, assistance also of every kind that she may
need and may herself desire. The treatment accorded
Russia by her sister nations in the months to come will
be the acid test of their good will, of their comprehension
of her needs as distinguished from their own interests,
and of their intelligent and unselfish sympathy.</i></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 175]<a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a></span>No restatement of the President's words on this
subject is necessary. The Russian revolution is one of
the most important results of the Great War. How
can the future welfare of Russia be best secured?</p>

<p>7. <i>Belgium, the whole world will agree, must be evacuated
and restored, without any attempt to limit the sovereignty
which she enjoys in common with all other free nations.
No other single act will serve as this will serve to restore
confidence among the nations in the laws which they have
themselves set and determined for the government of their
relations with one another. Without this healing act
the whole structure and validity of international law is
forever impaired.</i></p>

<p>The evacuation of Belgium will follow the military
victories of the United States and her associates. The
restoration of Belgium will be difficult to effect. It
implies relief to her suffering and starving people, the
return of the many exiles to Belgium, the erection of
new homes for them, the reorganization of industry and
transportation, and the repair and rebuilding of her
historic edifices. Where will the funds come from for
such work? Germany, the aggressor, surely should
bear a part or all of the cost.</p>

<p>8. <i>All French territory should be freed and the invaded
portions restored, and the wrong done to France by Prussia
in 1871 in the matter of Alsace-Lorraine, which has unsettled
the peace of the world for nearly fifty years, should
be righted, in order that peace may once more be made
secure in the interest of all.</i></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 176]<a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a></span>Here the President urges the same treatment for the
occupied lands of northern France as for those of Belgium.
The devastated lands must be reclaimed, the
inhabitants cared for, and adequate means provided
by which they can earn a livelihood. Further, he
advises the return of Alsace-Lorraine to France. Such
action not only will right the wrong done to France in
1871, but also it will take from Germany much of the
iron-producing areas which have made it possible for
her to prepare and carry on this war, and which might
permit her to get ready for a yet more dreadful war in
the future.</p>

<p>9. <i>A readjustment of the frontiers of Italy should be
effected along clearly recognizable lines of nationality.</i></p>

<p>We have seen how a considerable area inhabited by
Italians was not freed from Austrian rule when the
Italian kingdom was founded. This territory, called
Italia Irredenta (unredeemed Italy), and this population,
by its own desire and by natural right, belong to
Italy and should be brought within the nation.</p>

<p>10. <i>The peoples of Austria-Hungary, whose place
among the nations we wish to see safeguarded and assured,
should be accorded the freest opportunity of autonomous
development.</i></p>

<p>Within the Austro-Hungarian boundaries are several
nationalities which have been subjected to the oppressive
rule of peoples different from themselves. Their
attempts to obtain home rule or independence have
been crushed. America now wishes to secure for these
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 177]<a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a></span>peoples the opportunity to establish governments for
themselves. As we have already seen, our country
in 1918 formally recognized the independence of one of
these peoples&mdash;the Czecho-Slovaks, or inhabitants of
Bohemia and neighboring districts. Moreover, in a note
to Austria-Hungary, October 18, 1918, President Wilson
stated that conditions had changed since January 8, and
intimated that both the Czecho-Slovaks and the Jugo-Slavs
should be given independence.</p>

<p>11. <i>Roumania, Serbia, and Montenegro should be
evacuated, occupied territories restored, Serbia accorded
free and secure access to the sea, and the relations of the
several Balkan states to one another determined by friendly
counsel along historically established lines of allegiance
and nationality; and international guarantees of the
political and economic independence and territorial integrity
of the several Balkan states should be entered into.</i></p>

<p>We have here a comprehensive plan for the settlement
of the Balkan jealousies, which have disturbed Europe
for many years. Evacuation and restoration is here
proposed, as in Belgium and France. Serbia, always
thwarted by Austria in her hopes for a port, is to be
given access to the sea. Friendly counsel shall be given
the Balkan peoples to aid them in establishing their
governments along the lines of nationalities and of
historic sympathies. All the countries of the world
should unite to guarantee and protect the safety and
independence of the governments established in the
Balkan region.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 178]<a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a></span>12. <i>The Turkish portions of the present Ottoman
Empire should be assured a secure sovereignty, but the
other nationalities which are now under Turkish rule
should be assured an undoubted security of life and an
absolutely unmolested opportunity of autonomous development,
and the Dardanelles should be permanently
opened as a free passage to the ships and commerce of all
nations under international guarantees.</i></p>

<p>The horrible rule of the Turks over subject peoples
must cease. The Turks, as well as all other peoples,
should be allowed the right of self-government. But
their subject peoples must also be protected in their
lives, property, and occupations, and given an opportunity
to establish self-government when they desire it.
The Dardanelles strait must be taken out of the power
of the Turks, and placed under the control of the associated
nations.</p>

<p>13. <i>An independent Polish state should be erected
which should include the territories inhabited by indisputably
Polish populations, which should be assured a
free and secure access to the sea, and whose political and
economic independence and territorial integrity should be
guaranteed by international covenant.</i></p>

<p>A nation composed of Poles would imply the union
of parts of Russia, Prussia, and Austria, since all of
these three countries took part in the infamous partition
of Poland in the eighteenth century. Access to
the Baltic Sea would be necessary for the prosperity
and independence of the new state. But such access
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 179]<a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a></span>could be gained only across territory which Prussia
has held for a century and a half. The associated
nations would guarantee the independence of Poland
in the same way that they would protect Belgium,
Serbia, and the other states erected upon the principle
of national self-government.</p>

<p>14. <i>A general association of nations must be formed
under specific covenants for the purpose of affording
mutual guarantees of political independence and territorial
integrity to great and small states alike.</i></p>

<p>This is the most important of the President's suggestions.
Without some form of a league of nations it
will be impossible to adopt and carry out the other
terms of the President's program. International guarantees,
so frequently mentioned in his proposals, imply
some means by which the countries of the world can
act together for their common purposes. Restoration
of devastated lands, disarmament, new democratic
governments, freedom of commerce,&mdash;all of these
things will remain nothing but rainbow hopes unless
the large and small nations of the world unite for their
realization. A League of Nations, more or less regularly
organized, must be formed if the democracies of
the world shall be made safe from future wars of
aggression.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Suggestions for Study.</b>&mdash;1. Why are waters within three
miles of shore considered as territorial waters? (See <i>War Cyclopedia</i>,
"Marine League.") What is meant by freedom of the
seas? What is meant by the phrase "free ships make free goods"?
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 180]<a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a></span>2. Make a map of Europe showing what it would be like if all of
President Wilson's points were approved at the peace conference.
3. Are there any reasons why every nation should give up its
colonies and permit them to be independent states? 4. Why is
it dangerous as well as wrong to permit Germany to retain her
control over the territory taken from Russia? 5. What was the
"wrong done to France (by Germany) in 1870"? 6. What is
autonomy? Name the peoples of Austria-Hungary who wish
autonomous development, or complete independence. 7. Find
some ways by which Poland and Serbia can get access to the sea.
8. Do you think it will take a longer or a shorter time to bring
the soldiers home than it did to send them to France? Why?
9. What is meant by rehabilitation of the wounded? Find some
ways in which other nations have made their maimed soldiers
self-supporting. 10. How is it likely that Constantinople will
be controlled after the war? 11. How would the league of nations
enforce its decisions? (See President Wilson's second point.)</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
